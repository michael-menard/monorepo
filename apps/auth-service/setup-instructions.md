# Setup Instructions to Fix the Express Path-to-Regexp Error

Follow these steps to fix the path-to-regexp error and get your Express server running:

## Step 1: Clean and reinstall dependencies

```bash
# Remove node_modules and package-lock.json
npm run clean

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

## Step 2: Run the simplified app

```bash
# Run the simplified app to test basic Express functionality
npm run simple
```

If the simplified app runs successfully, the basic Express setup is working.

## Step 3: Gradually add complexity

Once the simplified app is working, you can gradually add back the routes and middleware from your original app, testing after each addition.

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Express 5.x compatibility issues**: Express 5 is still in beta and may have compatibility issues with some middleware. Downgrading to Express 4.x is often a good solution.

2. **Module resolution in TypeScript**: Make sure your import paths are correct and consistent. Don't mix `.js` extensions in imports when using TypeScript.

3. **Route parameters**: The path-to-regexp error often occurs when there's an issue with route parameters. Check that all route paths are properly formatted.

4. **Node.js version**: Make sure your Node.js version is compatible with your dependencies.

## Testing Your API

Once the server is running, test these endpoints:

- `http://localhost:5000/` - Should return basic server info
- `http://localhost:5000/api/hello` - Should return a "Hello, world!" message
- `http://localhost:5000/api/info` - Should return server information
