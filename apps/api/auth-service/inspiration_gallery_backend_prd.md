## 1. Overview
---


## 1.1 Implementation Details

- This is a **standalone React frontend** in a Turborepo workspace.
- Uses:
  - **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, **ShadCN UI** (installed via `packages/ui`)
  - **Framer Motion** for animations
  - **RTK** and **RTK Query** for state and data fetching
  - **React Hook Form** for managing forms
  - **Zod** for schema validation
  - **Helmet** for setting HTTP headers
  - **Winston** for frontend logging
  - **Testing Libraries**:
    - `vitest` as the test runner
    - `@testing-library/react` for component testing
    - `vitest-axe` for accessibility testing
  - **Accessibility Requirements**:
    - All interactive components must follow WCAG 2.1
    - Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes where appropriate
    - Lightbox and modals must trap focus and support `Esc` to close
    - All images and icons should have descriptive alt text or aria-hidden
- Development Notes:
  - Components must be styled with Tailwind + ShadCN only
  - ShadCN components should be imported from `packages/ui`
  - ESLint and Prettier are enforced
## 2. Components

- `<ImageUploadModal />`: Uses `FileUpload`, accepts `.jpg`, `.png`, `.heic`
- `<InspirationCard />`: Hover drawer, lightbox, tag display
- `<AlbumView />`: Reuses gallery layout for single album
- `<CreateAlbumDialog />`: Appears when dragging image onto another
- Multi-select checkbox + batch actions
