## Step 4: Add Instructions

Create step-by-step instructions for your build:

### Method 1: Manual Instructions

2. For each step, describe what pieces to add and where
3. Include clear descriptions of positioning and orientation
4. Add helpful tips for tricky sections

### Method 2: Photo Instructions

4. Ensure photos are clear and well-lit

### Method 3: Video Instructions
1. Record a video of the building process
2. Upload the video file
3. Add timestamps for key steps
4. Include narration explaining the process

## Step 5: Parts List

Create a comprehensive parts list:

1. **Part Number**: The official LEGO part number
2. **Quantity**: How many of each part you need
3. **Color**: The color of the part
4. **Description**: Any additional notes about the part

Example parts list:
```

3001        | 4        | Red   | 2x4 Brick
3002        | 2        | Blue  | 2x2 Brick

```

## Step 6: Add Images

Upload high-quality images of your completed MOC:

1. **Main Image**: A clear front view of your build
2. **Additional Views**: Side, back, top, and detail shots
3. **Size Reference**: Include a photo with a minifigure for scale
4. **Action Shots**: Show your MOC in use or posed

## Step 7: Review and Publish

Before publishing, review your MOC:

1. **Check Instructions**: Make sure all steps are clear and logical
2. **Verify Parts List**: Ensure all parts are listed correctly
3. **Test Instructions**: Have someone else follow your instructions

3. **Tags**: Use relevant hashtags to increase visibility
4. **Engage**: Respond to comments and feedback

## Tips for Success

### Writing Clear Instructions
- Use simple, clear language
- Number steps sequentially
- Include measurements when helpful
- Add warnings for fragile sections
- Provide alternatives for rare parts

### Taking Good Photos
- Use good lighting (natural light is best)
- Use a plain background
- Take photos from multiple angles
- Ensure the subject is in focus
- Use consistent lighting throughout

### Building Community

- Ask for feedback on your builds
- Collaborate with other builders
- Share your building process
- Be supportive of other creators

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Rushing**: Take your time to create quality instructions
2. **Poor Photos**: Blurry or poorly lit images make instructions hard to follow
3. **Missing Steps**: Don't skip steps, even if they seem obvious
4. **Incomplete Parts List**: Make sure all parts are listed with correct quantities
5. **No Testing**: Always test your instructions before publishing
