## Leveraging Existing Auth Package

### ✅ **What's Already Available**
The `@repo/auth` package provides:

**Components:**
- `Login` - Complete login form with validation
- `Signup` - Complete signup form with validation  
- `ForgotPassword` - Forgot password form
- `ResetPassword` - Reset password form
- `EmailVerification` - Email verification with OTP
- `Input` - Reusable input component
- `LoadingSpinner` - Loading indicator
- `PasswordStrength` - Password strength indicator
- `FloatingShape` - UI decoration component

**Hooks:**
- `useAuth` - Complete auth hook with all actions

**Store:**
- `authSlice` - Redux slice with all auth actions
- `authReducer` - Redux reducer
- `store` - Redux store configuration

**Types:**
- `User` - User interface
- `AuthState` - Auth state interface

### 🎯 **Our Strategy**
- **Use existing components** instead of rebuilding
- **Extend existing functionality** rather than replacing
- **Add missing features** (social login, enhanced UX)
- **Maintain consistency** with existing auth package
- **Test thoroughly** to ensure compatibility

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Authentication
Complete the foundational authentication system:
- ✅ Environment setup with existing auth package
- ✅ Redux store configuration using existing auth slice
- ✅ API client implementation
- ✅ Form validation (extend existing)
- ✅ Core components integration
- ✅ Route protection

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
Add advanced authentication features:
- Email verification with OTP (extend existing)
- Password reset functionality (extend existing)
- Social login integration (new)
- Automatic token refresh (extend existing)
- Comprehensive error handling (extend existing)

### Phase 3: Polish & Security
Final touches and security improvements:
- Loading states and UX improvements
- Security hardening
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Authentication success rate > 99%
- Token refresh success rate > 95%
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Form validation response < 100ms

### User Experience Metrics
- Login completion rate > 90%
- Signup completion rate > 85%
- Email verification completion rate > 80%
- Password reset completion rate > 75%
