# App Layout PRD

## Product/Feature Name: Authentication Layout with Mobile-First UI
### Version: 1.0
### Date: July 13, 2025
### Status: Draft

---

### Executive Summary
This project aims to create a mobile-first React web application that showcases a portfolio of a full-stack developer's skills. The app will have a shared layout with a top navbar, bottom footer, and dynamic content rendering using React Router's `<Outlet />` component. It will prioritize accessibility and provide a responsive design for both mobile and desktop users. The app will be integrated with **Shadcn UI** components (installed in the monorepo) and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. **RTK (Redux Toolkit)** will be used for state management, with **RTK Query** for API integration. Animations will be managed with **Framer Motion** or CSS animations.

### Core Layout Requirements

#### 1. Mobile-First Design
- **Responsive Layout**: The app will be fully responsive, starting with mobile as the primary view, expanding to desktop, and adjusting accordingly for larger screens.
- **Mobile Navbar**: On smaller screens (mobile), the navbar will be a slide-out drawer, accessible by clicking a hamburger menu.
- **Desktop Navbar**: For larger screens, the navbar will display horizontally with the logo on the left and login/signup links on the right.

#### 2. Top Navbar
- **Unauthenticated View**: 
   - Logo on the left.
   - Links to Login and Signup on the right.
   - On mobile, these will be in the slide-out menu.

- **Authenticated View**:
   - Logo on the left.
   - Profile image on the right. When clicked, a dropdown appears with:
     - A link to the profile page.
     - A log-out link.
   - The middle section of the navbar will have the following links:
     - Instructions (page with how to navigate the portfolio)
     - Projects (showcasing your full-stack projects)
     - Inspiration Gallery (a showcase of projects, designs, and inspirations)
     - Wishlist (a section with future development ideas)

#### 3. Main Content (Outlet for Route Pages)
- The layout component will serve as a shared wrapper for the entire application. The **`<Outlet />`** component from React Router will render the specific content for each route inside the layout.
- The content for each route (such as **Home**, **Login**, **Signup**, **Profile**, etc.) will be dynamically injected into the layout where the outlet is placed.

#### 4. Bottom Footer
- **Footer Layout**:
   - The footer will contain minimal information (such as copyright, social media links, and contact info). 
   - On mobile devices, the footer will be collapsible to maintain a clean look and feel.

#### 5. Authentication Flow
- **Initial State**: Users will land on a home page with access to login or sign-up.
- **After Successful Authentication**:
   - Users will be redirected to their profile page.
   - The navbar will update to show the profile image on the right, replacing the login/signup button.

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Ensure that all interactive elements (navbar links, buttons, etc.) are accessible via keyboard, with clear focus states.
- **Screen Reader Support**: All elements (especially interactive ones) should be labeled properly for screen readers. This includes:
   - Navbar links and buttons must have appropriate ARIA labels.
   - Form fields (login, signup, etc.) should be well-labeled and announce any validation errors.
- **Color Contrast**: Ensure that all text, links, and buttons meet WCAG 2.1 color contrast standards for visibility.
- **Focusable Elements**: The focus should move logically through interactive elements when navigating with the keyboard. Custom focus styles should be applied for clarity.

### Component Structure

#### Layout Component
The layout component will be shared across all pages and will include:
- **Top Navbar**: Dynamic based on authentication state (login/signup links for unauthenticated users, profile image and logout for authenticated users).
- **Outlet**: The `<Outlet />` component from React Router will render the dynamic content of each page (like Home, Login, Profile, etc.).
- **Footer**: A minimal footer that contains essential links and information.

#### Mobile Drawer
- On smaller screens, the navbar will be replaced by a hamburger-style drawer that slides in from the side.
- The mobile drawer will contain links for login/signup (if unauthenticated), or profile/logout (if authenticated).
- The drawer will also include links to the core sections: Instructions, Projects, Gallery, Wishlist.

### Technical Architecture & Design

#### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS** will be used to style the app's components, ensuring a mobile-first responsive design.
- **Shadcn UI** components will be used for accessible, reusable UI components (such as buttons, dropdowns, modals, etc.). These components should be installed in the **packages/ui** directory of the monorepo and exported for this app to import them.

  - **Shadcn UI** components to be installed and exported:
    - Button
    - Input
    - Label
    - Form
    - Toast
    - Card
    - Dialog
    - Separator
    - Loading Spinner

#### State Management
- **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** will be used for managing global application state.
- **RTK Query** will be used for handling API requests, specifically for authentication and user data.
  - Authentication flow (login, signup, logout) and profile data will be fetched and stored in the global state.
  - All API requests should be handled via RTK Query, providing a centralized and efficient approach for handling data fetching and caching.

#### Animations
- **Framer Motion** will be used for animations in the app, as it's already included as a dependency. It will be ideal for animating transitions like the mobile drawer and profile dropdown.
- Alternatively, **CSS animations** can be used for simpler transitions, such as fading in and out or sliding.

### Success Metrics
1. **Technical Metrics**
   - Mobile-first responsive layout with performance benchmarks: Load time < 2 seconds.
   - High accessibility standards met: WCAG 2.1 compliance score > 90%.

2. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Authentication flow completion rate > 90% (i.e., users successfully logging in or signing up).
   - Navbar usability: At least 90% of users should easily navigate between pages and interact with the profile dropdown.
   - Mobile drawer functionality: Smooth sliding and no navigation issues for > 95% of users.

### Next Steps:
1. **Design & Implement Layout**: Start by creating the shared `Layout` component with React Router's `<Outlet />` to render dynamic content.
2. **Mobile Drawer**: Implement the mobile navbar with a sliding drawer.
3. **Responsive Design**: Use Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities to adjust the navbar layout for mobile and desktop views.
4. **Authentication Flow**: Ensure the layout updates based on authentication state, showing the appropriate links.
5. **Shadcn UI Components**: Ensure all required Shadcn UI components are installed into the **packages/ui** directory and properly exported.
6. **State Management**: Implement RTK and RTK Query for managing authentication and user data.
7. **Animations**: Implement smooth animations using Framer Motion or CSS animations.
8. **Test & Iterate**: After implementation, test responsiveness, accessibility, and user flow to make sure the app is functioning smoothly across different devices.
