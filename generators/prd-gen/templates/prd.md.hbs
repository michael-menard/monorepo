# {{title}}

## Executive Summary
- **Problem**: [Concise description of the user/business pain]
- **Audience**: [Who is affected — personas, teams, customers]
- **Opportunity**: [Why solving this now creates value]
- **Desired Outcome**: [What “done right” looks like in one sentence]

## Goals
- Clear, outcome-focused bullets.

## Constraints & Standards (Must-Follow)
- Design system: shadcn/ui, Tailwind tokens
- Types: TypeScript + Zod
- State: RTK Query / Redux
- Testing: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)
- A11y: WCAG 2.2 AA, keyboard nav, axe clean
- Perf: Core Web Vitals budgets
- Security: no unsafe HTML, vetted links

## Acceptance Criteria
- Measurable, testable outcomes grouped by Phase A–E.

## Vertical Slices

### Phase A — Compile + Storybook
- Component compiles and renders stories

### Phase B1 — Unit Tests
- Critical logic covered

### Phase B2 — E2E Smoke
- Happy-path flows in Playwright

### Phase C — Accessibility
- Axe violations: 0, keyboard nav through all focusables

### Phase D — Performance
- Meets budgets; lazy/virtualize as needed

### Phase E — Security/Hardening
- No unsafe HTML, link policies enforced

## Rollout / Risks
- Flags, metrics, rollback plan.

## Appendix
- API shapes, diagrams, prior art.
