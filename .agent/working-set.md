## Active Constraints

1. Use Zod schemas for all types (never use TypeScript interfaces) — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
2. No barrel files (import directly from source files) — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
3. Use @repo/logger for logging, never use console.log — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
4. Named exports preferred over default exports — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
5. Minimum 45% test coverage required for all new code — _Source: CLAUDE.md_

## Recent Actions

- [x] Story frontmatter status updated
- [x] stories.index.md updated
- [x] CHECKPOINT.yaml created (phase: setup)
- [x] SCOPE.yaml created

## Next Steps

1. Read complete story requirements (WISH-20260.md)
2. Review elaboration analysis and decisions
3. Implement database migration for retry columns (retry_count, max_retries, next_retry_at, last_error)
4. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in cron job
5. Implement schedule repository updates for retry metadata
6. Add CloudWatch logging for retry attempts
7. Write comprehensive tests (45%+ coverage)
8. Run verification against all acceptance criteria
