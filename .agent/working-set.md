## Next Steps

1. Read story requirements in BUGF-015.md and ELAB-BUGF-015.md
2. Identify 24 untested components across main-app
3. Prioritize security-critical admin components (UnblockUserDialog, RevokeTokensDialog, AdminUserDetailPage)
4. Write tests for recently modified upload components (SessionProvider, UploaderFileItem, UploaderList, modals)
5. Write form validation tests (TagInput, SlugField)
6. Write tests for infrastructure components (module wrappers, navigation, pages)
7. Verify 60% coverage maintained across main-app
8. Run full test suite and generate coverage report
