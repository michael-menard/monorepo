## Active Constraints

<!-- Top 5 constraints. Sourced from CLAUDE.md + ADRs + story requirements. -->

1. Use Zod schemas for all types - runtime validation and self-documenting constraints — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
2. No barrel files (index.ts re-exports) - import directly from source files — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
3. Use @repo/logger instead of console.log for all logging — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
4. Minimum 45% test coverage globally — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
5. Named exports preferred over default exports — _Source: CLAUDE.md_

## Recent Actions

- [x] Setup complete, story moved to in-progress
- [x] CHECKPOINT.yaml created (iteration 0, phase: setup)
- [x] SCOPE.yaml created (packages: agents, contracts)
- [x] Status updated to In Progress

## Next Steps

1. Read full story requirements from WKFL-010.md and ELAB-WKFL-010.md
2. Review PM-phase analysis in _implementation/ (ANALYSIS.md, DECISIONS.yaml)
3. Design improvement-proposer.agent.md structure
4. Create /improvement-proposals command definition
5. Implement proposal schemas and tracking
6. Write unit tests
7. Run verification

## Open Blockers

_None_ — WKFL-002 dependency is completed (provides learning system infrastructure)
