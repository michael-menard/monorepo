## Active Constraints

<!-- Top 5 constraints. Sourced from CLAUDE.md + ADRs + story requirements. -->

1. **Use Zod schemas for validation** — Replace regex-based validation with Zod schemas; form validation must define precise constraints (price 0.00-999999.99, valid dates) — _Source: CLAUDE.md + story requirement_
2. **No barrel files (index.ts re-exports)** — Import directly from source files, never use barrel exports — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
3. **WCAG accessibility compliance** — Add ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation (Enter key submission), proper focus management for screen readers — _Source: story requirement_
4. **Use @repo/logger, not console.log** — All logging must use @repo/logger for consistency — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
5. **Minimum 45% test coverage** — Form validation logic and keyboard interaction tests required — _Source: CLAUDE.md_
