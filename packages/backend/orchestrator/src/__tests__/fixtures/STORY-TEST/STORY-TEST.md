# STORY-TEST: Test Fixture Story

## Goal

Provide a minimal, valid story structure for agent testing.

## Non-Goals

- Actually implementing anything
- Being used in production

## Scope

### In Scope

- Basic story structure validation
- Agent input/output testing

### Out of Scope

- Real functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC-1: Story file is valid YAML frontmatter + markdown
- [ ] AC-2: All required sections are present
- [ ] AC-3: TEST-PLAN.md exists in _pm/

## Reuse Plan

None required - this is a test fixture.

## Local Testing Expectations

Run validation scripts to ensure story structure is correct.

## Knowledge Context

This is a test fixture - no knowledge context required.
