      suggestion: "Add artifact preview/snippet in semantic search results"
      impact: medium
    - story: "Post-epic"
      suggestion: "Add story visualization showing dependency graph"
      impact: low

  accessibility_improvements:
    - story: "KBAR-007-010"
      suggestion: "Ensure all MCP query results include text summaries alongside structured data"

  suggested_stories:
    - title: "Knowledge base admin UI"
      gap: "Admin cannot currently browse/manage KB visually"
      priority: P2
    - title: "Search results ranking UI"
      gap: "Agents need way to refine semantic search results"
      priority: P2

  admin_future_ux:
    - flow: "Browse stories by status"
      phase: "Post-KBAR"
    - flow: "Search artifacts by keyword or semantic intent"
      phase: "Post-KBAR"
    - flow: "View story dependency graph"
      phase: "Post-KBAR"

  recommendations:
    - "Prioritize MCP tool documentation for agent developers"
    - "Create sample KB queries for common agent use cases"
    - "Plan admin UI after MCP tools stabilize (1-2 sprints post-launch)"

summary: "KBAR is agent-centric by design; core flows fully usable via MCP tools. Admin UI deferred to post-MVP (appropriate for current phase). No UX blockers for core journey."
