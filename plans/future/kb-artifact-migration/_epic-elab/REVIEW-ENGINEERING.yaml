  rationale: "KBAR phases are well-sequenced with clear dependencies; schema foundation (KBAR-001/002) enables downstream MCP/sync work; no blocking technical unknowns identified"

future:
  architecture_improvements:
    - suggestion: "Consider event-sourcing for story mutations once core sync stable"
      impact: medium
    - suggestion: "Add query caching layer for frequently-accessed story hierarchies"
      impact: low

  performance_considerations:
    - area: "File-to-DB sync performance with 200+ stories"
      suggestion: "Implement batch processing with hash-based change detection"
      impact: high
    - area: "MCP tool latency under concurrent agents"
      suggestion: "Add connection pooling and prepared statements"
      impact: medium

  recommended_patterns:
    - "Use workspace packages for shared sync utilities (packages/backend/knowledge-base)"
    - "Centralize MCP tool handlers in apps/api/knowledge-base/src/mcp-server"
    - "Implement graceful degradation if DB unavailable (fallback to file-based workflow)"

  suggested_stories:
    - title: "Performance test suite for file-DB sync"
      reason: "Validate scalability with large story counts"
      priority: P2
    - title: "Observability improvements for MCP tool execution"
      reason: "Agent debugging and performance monitoring"
      priority: P2

summary: "Architecture is sound with clear separation of concerns. File-DB sync strategy avoids coupling and maintains human-editable workflow. No MVP blockers identified."
