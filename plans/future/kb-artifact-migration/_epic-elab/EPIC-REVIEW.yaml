key_findings:
  architecture: "Hybrid storage (file + DB) with file-to-DB sync is sound. MCP tool integration well-designed. No coupling issues or technical blockers."
  core_journeys: "All three primary journeys fully supported: (1) Agent queries story by status/dependency; (2) Agent searches artifacts semantically; (3) Agent updates story status via MCP."
  infrastructure: "PostgreSQL, Lambda, API Gateway, and MCP server all ready. Deployment path clear with low-to-medium risk."
  testing: "Existing Vitest, MSW, and transaction isolation patterns directly applicable. Core journey fully testable across all phases."
  security: "No critical vulnerabilities. Agent-only access (MVP) simplifies threat model. Existing file system and IAM controls sufficient for internal use."
  ux: "Agent-centric design by nature. Core flows fully usable via MCP tools. Admin UI appropriately deferred to post-MVP."
