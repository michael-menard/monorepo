critical_insights:
  architecture_sound: "File-DB sync strategy maintains human editability while enabling agent automation"
  phases_well_sequenced: "Schema → Sync → MCP tools → Agent updates → Index → Lessons (clear dependencies)"
  no_infrastructure_gaps: "Aurora, Lambda, MCP server all ready; no deployment unknowns"
  test_strategy_executable: "Existing Vitest, MSW, transaction patterns directly applicable"
  security_model_sufficient: "Agent-only access MVP; file system + DB auth sufficient"

key_recommendations:
  - "Prioritize KBAR-001/002 (schema) to unblock downstream phases"
  - "Implement file-DB desynchronization recovery procedures in KBAR-003-006"
  - "Add structured logging for sync performance from day one"
  - "Plan semantic search quality validation early (KBAR-011-015)"
  - "Document MCP tool interfaces before agent migration (KBAR-016-022)"

post_mvp_priorities:
  high_impact:
    - "Automated lesson extraction (KBAR-025-027) reduces manual documentation"
    - "Semantic search query caching improves agent performance"
    - "Knowledge base admin UI (future phase) enables knowledge management"
  medium_impact:
    - "Event sourcing for story mutations (audit and time-travel)"
    - "Row-level security for multi-tenant scenarios"
    - "Chaos engineering tests for resilience"
  low_impact:
    - "Story visualization/dependency graphs"
    - "Advanced semantic search ranking UI"

risks_and_mitigations:
  high_risk:
    - risk: "File-DB desynchronization under concurrent writes"
      mitigation: "Hash-based change detection + transaction isolation + rollback procedures"
  medium_risk:
    - risk: "Semantic search index quality with diverse artifact types"
      mitigation: "Validation tests with 50+ representative stories before expansion"
    - risk: "MCP tool latency with 50+ concurrent agents"
      mitigation: "Connection pooling, prepared statements, performance regression tests"
  low_risk:
    - risk: "Database scaling at 500+ stories"
      mitigation: "Read replicas and query caching (post-MVP)"

review_process_notes:
  parallel_execution: "All 6 perspectives reviewed in parallel"
  analysis_depth: "Each perspective analyzed against MVP-critical criteria"
  consensus: "No disagreements between perspectives"
  confidence_level: "High (all 6 READY verdicts; no blockers)"

next_phase: "Aggregation → Interactive refinement → Updates"
