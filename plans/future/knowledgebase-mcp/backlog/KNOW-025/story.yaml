title: Embedding Vector Compression (Quantization)
points: null
priority: null
blocked_by: null
depends_on: []
follow_up_from: KNOW-002
scope:
  packages:
    - apps/api/knowledge
    - apps/api/knowledge
  surfaces:
    - backend
    - infra
goal: Reduce embedding storage footprint by 50-75% through vector quantization while maintaining search quality above
  95% relevance threshold (compared to unquantized baseline).
non_goals:
  - "**Compression of text content** - Only embedding vectors are in scope"
  - "**Runtime decompression** - pgvector handles quantized vectors natively"
  - "**Retroactive compression** - Existing embeddings remain uncompressed (migration deferred)"
  - "**Alternative vector databases** - Stay with PostgreSQL pgvector"
  - "**Multi-level quantization** - Single quantization strategy (int8 or float16, not both)"
