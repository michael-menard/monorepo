# UI/UX Notes: KNOW-040 Agent Instruction Integration

## Verdict

**SKIPPED**

## Justification

This story modifies agent instruction markdown files (`.claude/agents/*.agent.md`) to include KB search integration patterns. No user-facing UI components are touched.

**Changes are purely documentation:**
- Adding "Knowledge Base Integration" sections to agent files
- Documenting query patterns and examples
- Creating integration guide for future agents

No React components, no frontend code, no design system considerations.

**UI/UX review not applicable.**
