title: Semantic Deduplication for Near-Duplicate Content
points: null
priority: null
blocked_by: null
depends_on: []
follow_up_from: KNOW-002
scope:
  packages:
    - apps/api/knowledge
    - apps/api/knowledge
    - apps/api/knowledge
  surfaces:
    - backend
    - infra
goal: Reduce OpenAI API calls by 20-40% through semantic deduplication of near-duplicate content while maintaining
  embedding generation correctness and performance.
non_goals:
  - "**Fuzzy text matching** - Not implementing Levenshtein distance or text similarity algorithms (only embedding
    similarity)"
  - "**Automatic content normalization** - Not preprocessing text to remove duplicates (users provide content as-is)"
  - "**Deduplication across models** - Only within same embedding model (text-embedding-3-small)"
  - "**Cluster-based deduplication** - Simple threshold-based approach (no k-means clustering)"
  - "**UI for managing duplicates** - Automated detection only (manual management deferred to KNOW-024)"
