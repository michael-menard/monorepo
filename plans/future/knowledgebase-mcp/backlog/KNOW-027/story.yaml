title: Adaptive Batch Sizing Based on Rate Limit Headers
points: null
priority: null
blocked_by: null
depends_on: []
follow_up_from: KNOW-002
scope:
  packages:
    - apps/api/knowledge
    - apps/api/knowledge
    - apps/api/knowledge
  surfaces:
    - backend
    - frontend
    - infra
goal: Improve embedding generation throughput by 15-30% under rate limit pressure through adaptive batch sizing based on
  OpenAI rate limit headers.
non_goals:
  - "**Token-based rate limiting** - Focus on request-level limits only (defer token limits to future story)"
  - "**Predictive rate limit modeling** - Simple reactive adjustment (not ML-based prediction)"
  - "**Multi-account rate limit pooling** - Single API key only"
  - "**Rate limit dashboard** - Defer observability to KNOW-019 (Query Analytics)"
  - "**Automatic API key rotation** - Defer to KNOW-011 (Secrets Management)"
