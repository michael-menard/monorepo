recommendations:
  - "Start with KNOW-001 through KNOW-007 to establish stable KB, then carefully plan KNOW-008"
  - "After KNOW-006, run 2-3 pilot stories with kb_search integration before full KNOW-008 rollout"
  - "Define SLAs for KB availability and search performance"
  - "Create knowledge base usage dashboard to track agent adoption"
