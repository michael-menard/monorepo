verdict: conditional
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope now correctly matches MVP (local-only). Disaster recovery infrastructure, no endpoints, no feature
      creep.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: All 12 ACs align with local-only MVP. Goals, non-goals, AC, and test plan all consistent.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Correctly identifies @repo/logger reuse (optional for Bash), Docker Compose from KNOW-001. Scripts in
      knowledge-base package as operational tooling.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Backup/restore scripts isolated as external operational tools, not application logic. Clean separation.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: 7 happy path tests + 5 error cases + 5 edge cases. All executable in Docker with clear evidence requirements.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: "All key decisions made: Bash scripts, local filesystem storage, multi-tier retention, non-dev runbook validation,
      monthly DR drills. RTO/RPO targets documented (4h/24h)."
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "8 risks identified and mitigated: local storage failure, concurrent restore prevention, stale locks, data loss on
      cleanup failure, application downtime, etc."
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: 12 ACs, infrastructure/docs only, no endpoints. 5 story points appropriate for operational work.
