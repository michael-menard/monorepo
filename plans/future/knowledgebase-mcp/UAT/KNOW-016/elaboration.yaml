verdict: conditional
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope matches stories.index.md exactly. CloudWatch dashboards, alarms, and SNS topics are all within stated
      scope. No extra infrastructure or features introduced.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals, Non-goals, Decisions, and Acceptance Criteria are all aligned. Local Testing Plan (AWS CLI commands)
      matches AC requirements. No contradictions detected.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Infrastructure story that creates AWS resources. No shared package logic needed. Follows monorepo infrastructure
      patterns where applicable.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: "Proper separation of concerns: CloudWatch provides observability abstraction, SNS provides notification
      abstraction, IaC provides deployment abstraction. Infrastructure layer properly isolated."
  local_testability:
    status: conditional pass
    note: Test plan relies on AWS CLI commands against AWS resources. Story explicitly documents "monitoring is
      production-only" and local Docker Compose databases don't emit CloudWatch metrics. Testing limited to
      staging/production environments. This is acceptable given infrastructure nature, but creates testing dependency on
      AWS access.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: "All key decisions documented: AWS/RDS vs Custom metrics (uses AWS/RDS), IaC tooling (Terraform), alert thresholds
      (80% connections, 80% CPU, <10% memory, >100ms latency), SNS topic configuration (single topic per environment).
      No blocking TBDs."
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "Risks explicitly documented: Local vs Production metric source mismatch, threshold tuning without baseline data,
      SNS subscription confirmation required, IAM permission gaps, dashboard JSON complexity."
  story_sizing:
    status: conditional pass
    note: 13 ACs with QA Discovery items pending integration. User decisions integrate critical gaps into main ACs. Proceed
      as single story with clear implementation order (infrastructure first, then validation/docs). Infrastructure
      stories naturally have more ACs due to documentation requirements. Manageable with structured implementation.
