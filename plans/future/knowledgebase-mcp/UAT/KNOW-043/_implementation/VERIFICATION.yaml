  summary: |
    QA Verification PASSED. All acceptance criteria met and verified.

    VERIFICATION COMPLETED:
    - All 23 parser unit tests passing (100% coverage of parser logic)
    - Dependencies resolved: glob@10.3.10 and uuid@9.0.1 added to package.json
    - Migration script fully implemented with dry-run support
    - Parser handles multiple LESSONS-LEARNED.md formats with smart fallback
    - Agent instructions updated for KB-first workflow (write via kb_add, read via kb_search)
    - Deprecation notices added to both LESSONS-LEARNED.md files
    - Enhanced migration reporting with per-file metrics
    - Comprehensive documentation in docs/knowledge-base/lessons-learned-migration.md

    ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE:
    - Zod-first types used throughout (no TypeScript interfaces)
    - Proper directory structure with __types__/ and __tests__/
    - No barrel files, direct imports only
    - @repo/logger used for application logging
    - ES modules with .js extensions in imports
    - Reuses existing KB infrastructure (kb_bulk_import, embedding client)

    TEST QUALITY:
    - 23 tests covering all parsing scenarios (story headings, dates, categories)
    - Content hash deduplication tested
    - KB entry conversion tested with proper tagging
    - No anti-patterns or skipped tests
    - Clear assertions matching AC requirements

    READY FOR DEPLOYMENT:
    - Migration script can be executed: pnpm --filter knowledge-base tsx src/scripts/migrate-lessons.ts --dry-run
    - All agent workflows updated to use KB instead of markdown files
    - Historical lessons preserved in deprecated markdown files

    NOTE: Pre-existing axe-core TypeScript build issue noted but does not block KNOW-043 (migration files compile successfully).

gate:
  decision: PASS
  reason: "All 8 acceptance criteria verified and passing. Implementation complete, tested, and ready for deployment."
  blocking_issues: []
  notes:
    - "Parser tests: 23/23 passing"
    - "Dependencies resolved (glob, uuid added to package.json)"
    - "Architecture compliant (Zod-first, proper structure, reuse patterns)"
    - "Agent instructions updated for KB-first workflow"
    - "Documentation comprehensive and accurate"
