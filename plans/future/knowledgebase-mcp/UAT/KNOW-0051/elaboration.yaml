  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope matches stories.index.md exactly. All tools and deliverables align with split definition from KNOW-005.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals and Non-goals are consistent. AC aligns with scope. Test Plan covers all ACs.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Excellent reuse plan - all CRUD operations from KNOW-003, EmbeddingClient from KNOW-002, @repo/logger, Zod
      schemas. No one-off utilities.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Strong architecture diagram showing MCP server as adapter layer. Core logic delegated to CRUD operations.
      Transport-agnostic design.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: Integration test harness documented with MCP client mock. Test suite includes stdio protocol tests and direct
      handler tests.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: All design decisions documented. No TBDs or unresolved blockers. Schema generation strategy clear.
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "Four risks identified with clear mitigations: MCP SDK complexity, schema validation, error serialization,
      connectivity checks."
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: 9 ACs, 5 tools, backend-only, single package. Good sizing for foundation work.
