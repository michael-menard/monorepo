verdict: fail
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: fail
    note: Story was previously split into KNOW-0051, KNOW-0052, KNOW-0053 (all completed). Original KNOW-005 scope
      duplicates completed work.
  implementation_status:
    status: complete
    note: "All 10 MCP tools now implemented across three split stories: KNOW-0051 (5 CRUD tools), KNOW-0052 (2 search
      tools), KNOW-0053 (3 admin tool stubs)."
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Excellent reuse plan. Leverages existing CRUD operations (KNOW-003), search functions (KNOW-004), EmbeddingClient
      (KNOW-002), @repo/logger. All properly reused.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Excellent ports & adapters compliance. MCP server acts as thin adapter layer wrapping domain logic. Architecture
      validated.
  test_coverage:
    status: pass
    note: Split stories include comprehensive test coverage with 80%+ coverage targets and 25+ test scenarios across all
      three stories.
  documentation:
    status: pass
    note: Deployment topology, error handling, and lifecycle documentation completed in split stories.
  risk_mitigation:
    status: pass
    note: All 6 major risks disclosed and mitigated across split story implementations.
  story_completion:
    status: fail
    note: Story was already split and is now complete. Original KNOW-005 is obsolete and should not be re-implemented.
