## Story Overview

Define a type-safe story state enum using Zod that matches the Claude workflow lifecycle states.

## Feature

Create Zod enum for story lifecycle states (draft, backlog, ready-to-work, in-progress, ready-for-qa, uat, done)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Zod enum created in `packages/backend/orchestrator/src/schemas/story-state.ts`
- [ ] Enum includes all 7 states: draft, backlog, ready-to-work, in-progress, ready-for-qa, uat, done
- [ ] Type inference works: `type StoryState = z.infer<typeof StoryStateSchema>`
- [ ] Enum is exported from main index
- [ ] Unit tests verify all states
- [ ] Documentation includes state transition rules

## Dependencies

- None - foundation story

## Endpoints

None

## Infrastructure

None

## Goal

Define type-safe story state enum matching Claude workflow

## Risk Notes

None - straightforward enum definition

## Reuse Plan

- Use existing Zod patterns from `packages/backend/orchestrator/src/schemas/`
- No new shared packages needed
- Reuse schema validation patterns

## Token Budget

| Phase | Estimated | Actual | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Elaboration | ~5k | — | Schema definition straightforward |
| Implementation | ~3k | — | Simple enum definition |
| Code Review | ~2k | — | Minimal review scope |
| QA Verify | ~2k | — | Quick verification |
| **Total** | ~12k | — | Low-complexity story |
