mvp_blockers:
  - id: PROD-001
    issue: Edit form and validation (INST-1010) is essential for users to modify instructions
    stories: [INST-1010]
    action: Ensure edit form story is well-defined with clear acceptance criteria

  - id: PROD-002
    issue: Presigned URL upload handling (INST-1012) required for users to save large instruction files
    stories: [INST-1012]
    action: Story must clarify file size thresholds (≤10MB direct, >10MB presigned URL)

  - id: PROD-003
    issue: Unsaved changes guard (INST-1013) prevents data loss on accidental navigation
    stories: [INST-1013]
    action: Define UX for unsaved changes modal and navigation flow

missing_mvp_stories:
  - title: Edit flow entry point documentation
    user_journey: User accessing edit page from MOC detail view
    reason: Story INST-1009 mentions data fetching but entry point routing unclear

value_alignment:
  instruction_editing: Core user value - users need ability to fix and improve instructions
  file_management: Essential - users must add, remove, or replace files
  error_recovery: Important - users need protection against data loss scenarios

future:
  value_improvements:
    - story: INST-1006
      suggestion: Add rate limit observability to detect abuse patterns
      impact: medium
    - story: INST-1007
      suggestion: S3 cleanup job prevents wasted storage from failed uploads
      impact: low
    - suggestion: Post-MVP consider file reordering UI for better organization
      impact: medium

  suggested_stories:
    - title: Soft delete with restore (30-day retention)
      user_journey: User accidentally deletes instruction set
      priority: P2
      reason: Users protected against accidental deletion

    - title: Bulk edit operations
      user_journey: User wants to update multiple MOCs metadata
      priority: P2
      reason: Increases efficiency for power users

  recommendations:
    - Clarify MVP scope document to explicitly list which stories are required for edit feature launch
    - Add user acceptance testing criteria to each story (not just technical AC)
    - Ensure each story addresses user value, not just technical requirements
    - Define what happens when presigned URL expires during upload (recovery flow)

scope_notes:
  in_scope: Edit metadata (title, description, theme, tags), file add/remove, save with validation
  out_of_scope: File reordering, soft delete with restore (post-MVP), multipart uploads >100MB, gallery image uploads
  assumptions: PATCH endpoint exists and can handle metadata updates without file operations
