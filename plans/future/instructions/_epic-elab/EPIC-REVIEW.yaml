mvp_blockers:
  - id: CRITICAL-001
    source: qa
    issue: TEST MANDATE NOT DEFINED - All 18 stories lack explicit unit, integration, AND Playwright+Cucumber E2E test strategy
    stories: [INST-1000, INST-1001, INST-1002, INST-1003, INST-1004, INST-1005, INST-1006, INST-1007, INST-1008, INST-1009, INST-1010, INST-1011, INST-1012, INST-1013, INST-1014, INST-1015, INST-1028, INST-1029]
    action: REQUIRED - Elaborate every story with complete 3-part test strategy before development

  - id: CRITICAL-002
    source: qa
    issue: CUCUMBER FEATURE FILES NOT REFERENCED - E2E specification completely missing from stories
    stories: [INST-1001, INST-1028, INST-1029, INST-1009, INST-1010, INST-1011, INST-1012, INST-1013, INST-1014, INST-1015]
    action: REQUIRED - Each E2E-relevant story must reference feature file path and step definitions

  - id: CRITICAL-003
    source: qa
    issue: Integration test scope undefined for presigned URL (INST-1002) and edit save flow (INST-1012)
    stories: [INST-1002, INST-1012]
    action: REQUIRED - Define exact file size boundaries, upload scenarios, and error cases for tests

  - id: CRITICAL-004
    source: qa
    issue: Contract tests missing for edit endpoint (INST-1005) - frontend/backend schema alignment not verifiable
    stories: [INST-1005, INST-1009, INST-1010]
    action: REQUIRED - Add request/response schema validation tests to INST-1005

  - id: ENG-001
    source: engineering
    issue: Package extraction (INST-1003, INST-1004) must sequence as Wave 1-2 to unblock all consumers
    stories: [INST-1003, INST-1004, INST-1008, INST-1009, INST-1012]
    action: Update roadmap to ensure packages complete and tested before consumer stories start

  - id: ENG-002
    source: engineering
    issue: INST-1002 presigned URL endpoints critical dependency - must complete before edit save flow (INST-1012)
    stories: [INST-1002, INST-1012]
    action: INST-1002 must include 50MB integration test before INST-1012 implementation

  - id: ENG-003
    source: engineering
    issue: RTK Query mutation wiring (INST-1008) required before edit frontend stories
    stories: [INST-1008, INST-1010, INST-1012]
    action: Complete INST-1008 before elaborating edit form stories

  - id: PROD-001
    source: product
    issue: Edit form validation (INST-1010) lacks clear acceptance criteria for user workflow
    stories: [INST-1010]
    action: Story must define form layout, validation rules, and error message display

  - id: PROD-002
    source: product
    issue: Presigned URL file size thresholds (≤10MB direct, >10MB presigned) must be documented in INST-1012
    stories: [INST-1012]
    action: Story AC must explicitly state size boundaries and upload path selection logic

  - id: PROD-003
    source: product
    issue: Edit flow entry point and routing from MOC detail unclear
    stories: [INST-1009]
    action: Story must specify how users navigate to edit page and which edit URL pattern to use

  - id: UX-001
    source: ux
    issue: File management UI (INST-1011) lacks UX specification for file picker and remove confirmation
    stories: [INST-1011]
    action: Story must include wireframe or UX description for file add/remove flows

  - id: UX-002
    source: ux
    issue: Unsaved changes guard (INST-1013) lacks modal UX design and button labels
    stories: [INST-1013]
    action: Story must specify confirmation modal behavior and navigation handling

  - id: UX-003
    source: ux
    issue: Upload progress indication missing from core flow - users won't know save status
    stories: [INST-1012]
    action: INST-1012 must include progress bar or status indicator during file upload

missing_mvp_stories:
  - title: Complete test strategy definition for all 18 stories
    source: qa
    reason: Core journey completely untestable without unit, integration, and E2E test specifications

  - title: Cucumber feature file paths for E2E scenarios
    source: qa
    reason: E2E workflow specification required before implementation can begin

  - title: Edit flow integration test scenarios
    source: qa
    reason: End-to-end edit page → form → save → API flow needs dedicated test story

  - title: Upload progress indication UX
    source: ux
    reason: Users need visual feedback during file upload in save flow

stories_to_split:
  - story: INST-1029
    reason: Create flow validation includes search endpoint audit - consider splitting into separate validation story

  valid: true
  concern: All stories in critical path lack complete test specifications

execution_readiness:
  foundation_stories: READY (INST-1003, INST-1004) - once test specs added
  edit_backend: CONCERNS (INST-1005-1007) - dependency and test specs
  edit_frontend: CONCERNS (INST-1009-1015) - UX and test specs needed
  testing_stories: CONCERNS (INST-1028, INST-1029) - test strategy required
  overall_status: BLOCKED pending test mandate elaboration

next_phase_recommendation:
  action: Return to elaboration phase for all 18 stories
  focus: Define complete test strategy (unit + integration + E2E with Cucumber) for each story
  gate: QA sign-off required on test specifications before any implementation begins
  timeline_impact: Add 1-2 days for test strategy elaboration across all stories
