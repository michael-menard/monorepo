    issue: Edit form validation (INST-1010) required for users to submit edits
    stories: [INST-1010]
    action: Story must include form validation UX, error messages, and submit button state management

  - id: UX-002
    issue: File management UI (INST-1011) required for users to add/remove files
    stories: [INST-1011]
    action: Story must clarify file picker UX, file list display, remove confirmation flow

  - id: UX-003
    issue: Unsaved changes guard (INST-1013) required to prevent data loss on navigation
    stories: [INST-1013]
    action: Story must define modal UX, button labels, and navigation handling

missing_mvp_stories:
  - title: Upload progress indication during save
    gap: Core flow step (uploading new files) lacks progress UX
    severity: HIGH

  ux_polish:
    - story: INST-1015
      suggestion: Add inline edit mode alternative to modal/page (post-MVP)
      impact: medium
    - story: INST-1011
      suggestion: Drag-to-reorder files for organization (post-MVP)
      impact: low

  accessibility_improvements:
    - story: INST-1009
      suggestion: Ensure edit page accessible via keyboard navigation
    - story: INST-1010
      suggestion: Form fields properly labeled with aria-labels
    - story: INST-1015
      suggestion: Focus management when modal opens/closes

  suggested_stories:
    - title: Bulk edit interface
      gap: Users cannot edit multiple MOCs metadata at once
      priority: P2
    - title: Edit undo/redo
      gap: Users cannot recover from form field mistakes
      priority: P2

  recommendations:
    - Create wireframes for edit page layout showing form fields, file list, and action buttons
    - Define success/error states for file upload progress
    - Specify focus management and keyboard navigation flow
    - Add ARIA labels and semantic HTML requirements to acceptance criteria

design_system_alignment:
  uses_existing_components: Button, Form, Modal, Card from @repo/app-component-library
  new_components_needed:
    - FileUploadInput (drag-drop and file picker)
    - FileListItem (display existing files with remove action)
    - UploadProgressBar (shows upload progress during save)
  theme_adherence: Sky/Teal palette expected, consistent with dashboard and gallery apps

interaction_design:
  form_submission: INST-1010 (clear disabled state while uploading)
  error_feedback: INST-1012 (show which files failed, retry options)
  unsaved_changes: INST-1013 (confirm before leaving)
  session_recovery: INST-1014 (restore form state after crash)
