## User Decisions

gap_1_dependency:
  finding: RTK Query hook dependency on INST-1008
  decision: Wait for INST-1008
  reason: Keep dependency, INST-1008 must complete before INST-1100 starts
  implementation_note: Do not expand scope; wait for INST-1008 completion

gap_2_hook_naming:
  finding: Hook naming clarity - useGetMocsQuery vs useGetInstructionsQuery
  decision: Accept both as equivalent
  reason: INST-1008 creates both hooks pointing to same endpoint
  implementation_note: Implementer can use either; document as equivalent

## Conditions for Implementation

- [ ] INST-1008 must be completed and merged
- [ ] RTK Query hook must be available in @repo/api-client
- [ ] Backend GET /mocs endpoint returns thumbnailUrl field

## Ready-to-Work Status

All gaps resolved via user decisions.
Story may proceed to in-progress status after INST-1008 completion.
No blockers remaining.

## Follow-up Actions

- [ ] Move story to ready-to-work/ directory
- [ ] Update stories.index.md with ready-to-work status
- [ ] Link from ELAB-INST-1100.md to story location
