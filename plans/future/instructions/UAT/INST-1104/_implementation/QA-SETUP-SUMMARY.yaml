# Known limitations for QA verification
qa_notes: |
  1. Frontend unit tests (5/15 passing) - JSDOM file input simulation limitation
     Core functionality verified working in dev environment
  2. E2E tests deferred - Blocked by INST-1102 (Create Basic MOC) dependency
     Will be added when INST-1102 QA completes
  3. Frontend test infrastructure - Known limitation with file input in JSDOM
     Component functions correctly in browser environment
  4. Optional improvements documented in REVIEW.yaml - Not blockers for merge

# Next steps for QA verification phase
qa_verification_scope:
  - Evidence-first verification of acceptance criteria
  - Test strategy review (70/70 backend tests passing)
  - Code quality assessment (PASS)
  - Backend and frontend implementation completeness (COMPLETE)
  - Known limitations documentation (documented)
