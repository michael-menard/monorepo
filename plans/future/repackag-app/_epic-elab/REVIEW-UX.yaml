recommendations:
  - "Phase 2 (Gallery Enhancement) has strong direct UX impact—prioritize REPA-007/008/009 to unblock REPA-010 full refactor"
  - "All Phase 1 (Upload) stories are internal refactoring with no user-facing UX change if parity is maintained"
  - "Phase 3+ (Hooks/Services/Schemas) are invisible to users if APIs remain stable—no UX risk"
  - "Conduct visual regression testing on all migrated gallery components to ensure pixel-perfect parity"
  - "Test keyboard navigation (Tab, arrow keys, Enter) thoroughly on SortableGallery before shipping"
