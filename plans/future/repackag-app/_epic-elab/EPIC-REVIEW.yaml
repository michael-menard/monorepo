## QA Concerns & Rationale

QA verdict is CONCERNS due to:
1. No acceptance criteria defined for stories
2. No test strategy document
3. No E2E test scenarios defined
4. Missing rollback/regression test plan for breaking changes
5. No integration test matrix for multi-app migrations

**Important:** These concerns are valid but expected at the epic level. Acceptance criteria, test strategy, and concrete test scenarios are defined during story elaboration phase (which happens in `/elab-story`), not at epic review. The workflow architecture anticipates this - epic review establishes feasibility and architecture; story elaboration establishes implementation details including testing.

This is process risk, not delivery risk. The 21 stories are architecturally sound and the testing concerns will be systematically addressed as each story moves to elaboration.
