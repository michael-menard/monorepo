verdict: READY

scope:
  core_journey_complete: true
  mvp_defined: true

value_proposition: |
  Eliminate ~10,800 lines of duplicate code across 50+ files by consolidating
  into 9 shared packages. Core DX improvement enabling faster feature delivery
  and consistent developer experience across 6+ apps.

mvp_definition: |
  MVP = Phase 1 (Upload Consolidation) + Phase 2 (Gallery Enhancement)
  deliverables. Creates 2 foundational packages (@repo/upload, @repo/gallery)
  that enable the remaining consolidation phases. Unblocks 12 ready-to-start
  stories producing immediate deduplication value.

critical_path: REPA-001 → REPA-002 → REPA-003 → REPA-005 → REPA-017
critical_path_length: 5 stories

parallel_work_available: 12 stories can start immediately (no blockers)

scope_assessment: |
  Epic is well-structured with clear phases and dependencies. 21 stories total
  organized into 6 phases. No hidden scope. Phase 1-2 forms coherent MVP.

  value_improvements:
    - story: REPA-003
      suggestion: "Add feature flag for gradual upload hook rollout to reduce breaking change risk"
      impact: high
    - story: REPA-005
      suggestion: "Split 7-component consolidation into REPA-005a (core) and REPA-005b (optional sub-components) to reduce task size"
      impact: high
    - story: REPA-007
      suggestion: "Add API extensibility testing early to validate all gallery app use cases"
      impact: medium
    - story: REPA-010
      suggestion: "Document app refactor patterns in Storybook for team consistency"
      impact: medium

recommendations:
  - >-
    Phase 1 (Upload): Prioritize REPA-001 → REPA-002 for quick deprecation
    pattern win. Establishes team rhythm.
  - >-
    Phase 2 (Gallery): REPA-007 + REPA-008 in parallel with Phase 1 to
    unlock high-value consolidation without wait time.
  - >-
    Risk mitigation: Create migration guides early for deprecated packages
    (@repo/upload-client, @repo/upload-types) to ease team adoption.
  - >-
    Success metrics: Track LOC reduction by phase, measure test coverage
    maintained/improved across migrations.
