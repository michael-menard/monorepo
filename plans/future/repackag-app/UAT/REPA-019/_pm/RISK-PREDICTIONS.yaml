# Prediction Rationale:
#
# split_risk: 0.3 (LOW-MEDIUM)
# - AC count: 10 ACs (base_risk = 0.7 from formula: (10-3)*0.1)
# - Scope complexity: No frontend/backend split (-0.0), no database (-0.0), no auth/security (-0.0)
# - Package consolidation pattern: Well-scoped, self-contained utilities
# - ADJUSTED DOWN: This is a straightforward code move with dependency injection refactor
# - Final: 0.3 (low-medium risk)
#
# review_cycles: 2 (TYPICAL)
# - Base cycles: 1
# - Complexity: Dependency injection refactor (+1)
# - Estimated files: ~8 files (error-mapping, auth-failure, tests, package.json)
# - No auth/security complexity (error handling utilities, not auth logic)
# - Final: 2 cycles expected
#
# token_estimate: 120000 (BELOW AVERAGE)
# - Similar package consolidation stories (REPA-012, REPA-013, REPA-016) in progress
# - No OUTCOME.yaml available yet for similar stories
# - Scope: ~632 LOC to move + ~653 test LOC to migrate + dependency injection refactor
# - Heuristic: Code move stories typically ~100-150K tokens
# - ADJUSTED DOWN: Well-defined scope, no complex logic changes
# - Final: 120K tokens (below global default of 150K)
#
# confidence: medium
# - 3 similar stories identified but no OUTCOME.yaml data yet
# - WKFL-006 patterns not available (heuristics-only mode)
# - Scope is well-defined in seed file
# - Similar to other REPA consolidation stories
