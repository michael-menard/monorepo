  notes: |
    Predictions based on heuristics only (no similar stories available in KB).

    Split risk calculation:
    - Base risk from AC count: (17 - 3) * 0.1 = 1.4 → clamped to 1.0
    - Scope complexity: infrastructure-only (-0.5 adjustment)
    - No frontend/backend interaction (-0.3 adjustment)
    - Final: 0.2 (low risk, pure package structure)

    Review cycles:
    - Base: 1 cycle (infrastructure story)
    - Scope keywords: 0 (no auth, security, database)
    - File count: ~10 files (+1 cycle for config verification)
    - Final: 2 cycles (config review + structure validation)

    Token estimate:
    - No similar stories found
    - Infrastructure-only stories typically lower cost
    - Estimated: 120K tokens (below global default due to simple scope)
    - Conservative estimate given 17 ACs, but most are structure verification
