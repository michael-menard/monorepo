KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

Strengths:
  1. Factory function pattern successfully applied from column-helpers.tsx
  2. All 4 domain card factories implemented with consistent API
  3. Comprehensive type safety via Zod schemas (AC-5, AC-6, AC-7)
  4. Excellent test coverage: 39 unit tests across 4 files
  5. CLAUDE.md compliance verified (no barrel files, direct imports)
  6. hoverOverlay API correctly implemented (REPA-009 breaking changes)
  7. Strong documentation: 328-line README + JSDoc comments

Deferrals (Documented & Acceptable):
  1. AC-12 (Storybook basic usage stories)
     - Reason: @repo/gallery package lacks Storybook setup
     - Mitigation: README provides comprehensive usage examples
     - Impact: Documentation only, no functional impact

  2. AC-13 (Storybook side-by-side comparison)
     - Reason: @repo/gallery package lacks Storybook setup
     - Mitigation: README includes migration path & comparison
     - Impact: Documentation only, no functional impact

Quality Notes:
  - All review fixes from iteration 1 applied correctly
  - Code style: no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas
  - Zod pattern: .optional() preferred (not .default())
  - Type safety: z.custom<> for complex types (not z.any())
  - Architecture: Direct imports, no barrel files
