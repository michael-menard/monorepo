  calculation_notes:
    split_risk_rationale: |
      Base risk from AC count (7 ACs): (7-3)*0.1 = 0.4
      No frontend + backend complexity boost (pure backend/infra = -0.1): 0.3
      Multi-file migration (52 import sites) adds complexity: +0.1 = 0.4
      No auth/security/database involvement (no additional boost)
      Final: 0.4 (medium-low risk)
    review_cycles_rationale: |
      Base cycles: 1
      Multi-file migration (52 sites): +1 = 2
      No auth/security/database: no additional cycles
      Estimated files to change: ~60 (52 imports + client files + tests)
      Final: 2 cycles (one for implementation, one for thoroughness check)
    token_estimate_rationale: |
      No similar stories available (KB search not performed, would require kb_search tool)
      Using heuristic: 7 ACs * 15K tokens/AC baseline = 105K
      Multi-file migration overhead: +15K tokens = 120K
      Fallback to conservative estimate given no historical data
      Final: 120,000 tokens
    confidence_rationale: |
      Low confidence due to:
      - No similar stories loaded (KB search not performed)
      - WKFL-006 patterns unavailable (patterns directory missing)
      - Heuristics-only mode with no historical data
      - First story in REPA epic (no domain-specific baseline)
  degradation_mode: heuristics_only
  missing_data:
    - WKFL-006 patterns file not found (plans/future/workflow-learning/patterns/)
    - KB similar stories not loaded (kb_search tool not available in this context)
    - No outcome files from similar migration stories
