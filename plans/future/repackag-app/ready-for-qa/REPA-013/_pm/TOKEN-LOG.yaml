notes: |
  Story generated directly from STORY-SEED.md which contained comprehensive
  context including 8 detailed ACs, reality baseline, reuse recommendations,
  and worker guidance. Seed quality was excellent (1,426 lines of existing
  tests documented, clear migration strategy, no conflicts).
  
  Workers were not spawned due to Task tool unavailability, but seed
  contained sufficient detail for high-quality story synthesis.
