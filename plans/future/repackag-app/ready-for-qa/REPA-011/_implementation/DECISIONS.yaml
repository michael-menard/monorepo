      finding: "Active Filters Display: Build status filter NOT shown in active filters chips"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Non-blocking gap. Active filters display doesn't show build status filter chips - explicitly called out in story as non-MVP-blocking, deferred to REPA-012."

      finding: "Clear All Filters: May not reset build status filter depending on onClearAll implementation"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Non-blocking gap. Edge case that can be verified during implementation testing. Parent must explicitly reset build status in custom onClearAll handler."

    - id: 3
      finding: "Filter Keyboard Navigation: Build status filter keyboard accessibility not explicitly tested"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Non-blocking gap. Should work automatically via AppSelect but worth verifying. Low impact, low effort."

      finding: "Filter Tooltips: No tooltips explaining filter purpose"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "UX polish enhancement. Would add tooltips explaining 'All statuses', 'Built', 'In Pieces'. Low impact, low effort."

      finding: "Filter Icons: Build status filter has no visual icon"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "UX polish enhancement. Could add visual icons (CheckSquare for built, Box for unbuilt). Low impact, low effort."

    - id: 3
      finding: "Generalized StatusFilter Component: BuildStatusFilter is sets-specific"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Reusability enhancement. Only generalize if second use case emerges (YAGNI principle). Low impact, medium effort."

      finding: "Filter State Persistence: Build status filter not persisted to URL or localStorage"

      finding: "Filter Analytics: No tracking for build status filter usage"
      decision: "KB-logged"

      finding: "Mobile Filter Panel: Filters could be collapsed into drawer on mobile for better space usage"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "UX polish enhancement. Would reduce visual clutter on small screens. Requires design input and new FilterDrawer component. Medium impact, high effort."

      kb_entry_id: null
      kb_status: deferred
    - id: 7
      finding: "Filter Presets: No quick filter presets (e.g., 'Recently Built', 'Unbuilt Modulars')"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "UX polish enhancement. Would require new FilterPresets component and preset configuration system. Medium impact, high effort."

    - id: 8
      finding: "Filter Count Badges: No indication of how many items match each filter option"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "UX polish enhancement. Would show count badges in dropdown (e.g., 'Built (5)'). Requires passing filter counts from backend. Low impact, medium effort."

notes: |
  All audit checks passed with no defects. Story is well-structured, complete, and ready for implementation.

  No MVP-critical gaps identified. All 13 non-blocking findings (3 gaps + 10 enhancements) logged for future reference.

  KB tools unavailable - all KB writes deferred with kb_status: deferred. When KB becomes available, process these findings:
  - Gap #1 (Active filters display) → Priority 1, REPA-012 candidate
  - Enhancement #4 (URL persistence) → Priority 2, significant UX value
  - Enhancement #3 (Generalization) → Priority 3, only if second use case emerges
  - Remaining enhancements → Monitor and prioritize based on user feedback

  Story approved as-is with no AC additions required.
