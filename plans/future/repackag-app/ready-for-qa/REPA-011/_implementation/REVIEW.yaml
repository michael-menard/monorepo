summary: |
  Code review of REPA-011 implementation passed all quality gates. The implementation
  demonstrates strong adherence to CLAUDE.md guidelines:

  **Lint/Style (PASS)**
  - Prettier formatting correct (100 char width, 2-space indent, single quotes, no semicolons)
  - All 6 unit tests pass without errors
  - No console.log usage detected

  **Type Safety (PASS)**
  - BuildStatusFilter component uses Zod schemas correctly
  - Proper z.infer<> type inference for BuildStatusFilterProps and BuiltFilterValue
  - No TypeScript compilation errors in touched files
  - Note: Shared libraries (GalleryFilterBar, GalleryThemeFilter, AppSelect) use interfaces
    which are pre-existing patterns; new REPA-011 code correctly uses Zod

  **Code Quality (PASS)**
  - Proper component directory structure with __types__ subdirectory
  - Named exports used throughout
  - No barrel files
  - All imports use @repo/* package aliases, not individual paths
  - Tests use semantic queries (getByRole, getByLabelText, getByLabelText with aria-label)
  - Comprehensive JSDoc comments in BuildStatusFilter
  - Proper test patterns with MSW mocking and Redux store setup

  **Security (PASS)**
  - No XSS vulnerabilities detected
  - No dangerouslySetInnerHTML usage
  - AppSelect component includes input sanitization
  - Proper ARIA labels for accessibility

  **Build Verification**
  - Gallery package builds successfully
  - Tests pass 6/6 for main-page.test.tsx
  - Pre-existing @repo/app-component-library build failure (FeatureSchema export) is
    unrelated to REPA-011 and documented in EVIDENCE.yaml as known deviation

  **Accessibility Enhancements (NEW)**
  - Added aria-label prop support to GalleryFilterBar (themeAriaLabel, sortAriaLabel)
  - Added aria-label prop support to GalleryThemeFilter
  - Added aria-label prop support to AppSelect
  - BuildStatusFilter includes accessible label with sensible default
  - All filter controls properly labeled for screen readers
