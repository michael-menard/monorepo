    Split Risk Calculation (0.2):
    - Base risk from AC count: 9 ACs → (9-3)*0.1 = 0.6
    - Scope complexity: Frontend only (no backend/auth) → -0.4
    - Pattern boost: Component consolidation pattern is low-risk → -0.0
    - Final: min(1.0, max(0.0, 0.2)) = 0.2

    Review Cycles Calculation (2):
    - Base cycles: 1
    - Complexity signals: Frontend+tests+Storybook → +1
    - Auth/security: No → +0
    - Database: No → +0
    - Estimated files: ~15 (9 ACs * 1.5 frontend) → +0
    - Final: 2 cycles

    Token Estimate (120000):
    - No similar stories found in KB (empty similar_stories array)
    - Using heuristic: Frontend-only refactoring with tests and docs
    - Component consolidation typically 100K-150K tokens
    - Conservative estimate: 120,000 tokens

    Confidence (medium):
    - No similar stories found (low data)
    - But scope is well-defined and low-risk (medium confidence)
    - WKFL-006 patterns not available (degraded mode)
