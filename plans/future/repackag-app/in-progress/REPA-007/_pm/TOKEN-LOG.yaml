notes:
  - Token usage is approximate based on agent execution context
  - Input tokens include reading seed, agent files, existing test files, and index
  - Actual token usage may vary due to LLM caching and context optimization
  - Story is complex (34 ACs) with comprehensive test plan and feasibility analysis
  - Token estimate from predictions: 180,000 tokens (includes full dev implementation)
  - PM generation used ~74K tokens (story generation only, not implementation)
