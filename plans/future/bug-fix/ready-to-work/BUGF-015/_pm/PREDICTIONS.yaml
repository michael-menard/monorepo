# Analysis Notes:
# - Story has 8 acceptance criteria (medium complexity)
# - Scope: 24 test files (large scope for test story)
# - Domain: frontend unit testing (no backend, no database)
# - Estimated files: 24 (test files only)
# - Scope keywords: frontend, multi-file, test-coverage
# - Split risk moderate (0.6) due to large scope (24 components)
# - Review cycles normal (2) for medium-complexity work
# - Token estimate conservative (140K) for test-only story with established patterns
# - Confidence low due to lack of historical data
