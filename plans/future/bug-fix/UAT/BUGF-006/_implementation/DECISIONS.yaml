  minor_issues:
    - id: 1
      issue: "AC-1 console count mismatch"
      severity: Low
      resolution: "No action needed - verification confirms exactly 5 occurrences as stated"
      notes: "Could be more specific about line numbers, but count is correct"

    - id: 2
      issue: "Logger import already exists in app-instructions-gallery"
      severity: Low
      resolution: "Developer to verify during setup - standard practice"
      notes: "AC-5 assumes imports may be missing; developer should check first"

    - id: 3
      issue: "AC-4 scope reduced from story seed"
      severity: Info
      resolution: "No action needed - intentional refinement correctly documented"
      notes: "MSW handlers documented as exception; scope reduction is appropriate"

    - id: 4
      issue: "AC-2 wording imprecision"
      severity: Low
      resolution: "No action needed - implementation is unambiguous"
      notes: "Both console statements are console.log; minor clarity issue only"

      status: PASS
      resolution: "Minor issues documented but non-blocking; MSW handler decision is adequate"
