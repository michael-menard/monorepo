  - issue: "AC-9 False Positive Corrected: Git status reflects concurrent work from other stories"
    severity: INFORMATIONAL
    recommendation: "No action required - git status snapshot contains changes from REPACKAG-APP and BUGF-003 refactoring"
    details:
      - "BUGF-006 implementation confirmed to modify ONLY 3 source files via EVIDENCE.yaml"
      - "Test file modifications in git status are from concurrent stories (verified via artifact)"
      - "This is expected in a monorepo with concurrent feature work"

  - issue: "AC-7 Pre-existing TypeScript errors - Not caused by BUGF-006"
    severity: INFORMATIONAL
    recommendation: "Pre-existing errors are technical debt tracked separately - does not block BUGF-006"
    details:
      - "Errors in api-client package (Feature, FeatureSchema exports)"
      - "Errors in app-component-library (FeatureGate, QuotaIndicator)"
      - "Errors in MocEdit/EditForm components (react-hook-form version mismatch)"
      - "These are NOT caused by BUGF-006 changes - verified via TypeScript compilation output"
      - "Status: PASS - BUGF-006 modified files have no new errors"

  - task: "AC-8: Test logger output in browser"
    steps:
      - "Start app-inspiration-gallery dev server"
      - "Open browser console"
      - "Trigger actions that call logger.info (add to albums, link to MOCs, open album, menu click, edit album)"
      - "Verify logger output appears with proper formatting and context objects"
      - "Repeat for app-instructions-gallery (edit instruction, toggle favorite)"
      - "Repeat for main-app admin user detail page (error handlers for revoke tokens, block user, unblock user)"
