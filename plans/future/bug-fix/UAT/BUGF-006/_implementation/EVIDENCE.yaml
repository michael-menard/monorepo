notable_decisions:
  - "Used structured logging pattern with context objects (e.g., { albumIds }, { userId, error }) instead of string concatenation for better log aggregation and searchability"
  - "Fixed import order violations automatically with eslint --fix to comply with import/order rules"
  - "Preserved all existing functionality - only replaced logging mechanism, no behavioral changes"
