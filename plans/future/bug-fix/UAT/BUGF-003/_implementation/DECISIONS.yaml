  gaps:
    - id: 1
      finding: "No undo functionality for delete operation"
      decision: "KB-logged"

      finding: "No real-time conflict detection if set edited by another session"
      decision: "KB-logged"

    - id: 4
      finding: "No audit log of changes to set metadata"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Non-blocking observability gap. Useful for tracking changes but not critical for MVP. Part of broader audit logging feature."

    - id: 5
      finding: "Image reordering not supported in edit page"
      decision: "KB-logged"

    - id: 6
      finding: "Validation of duplicate set numbers"
      decision: "KB-logged"

      category: "edge-case"
    - id: 7
      finding: "Edit page image upload flow differs from add page"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Non-blocking consistency gap. Potential to unify flows but requires refactoring both pages. Low priority."

    - id: 8
      finding: "No conversion from wishlist item to set"

  enhancements:
    - id: 1
