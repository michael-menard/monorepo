verdict: "PASS"

findings: []

summary: "All three test files pass comprehensive review. Code follows CLAUDE.md style guidelines (no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas, 2-space indentation). No console.log usage. MSW pattern correctly used for RTK Query mocking (not mocking hooks directly). All 40 tests pass successfully. Test quality is high with meaningful assertions, proper async handling, semantic queries, and good coverage of component features. No TypeScript errors. Imports are clean and proper. Accessibility patterns properly validated."
