    - id: 8
      finding: "No test for image load failures in cards and skeletons"
      decision: "Deferred to KB"

    - id: 9
      finding: "No test for screen reader announcements during drag operations"
      decision: "Deferred to KB"

notes: |
  - All 8 audit checks passed with no critical issues
  - Zero MVP-critical gaps identified - story is complete and ready for implementation
  - 4 low-severity informational issues documented (all non-blocking)
  - 20 enhancement opportunities identified for future work
  - 10 non-blocking gaps identified as edge cases
  - All findings deferred to Knowledge Base for future reference
  - Story can proceed to ready-to-work without modifications
  - Implementer has discretion to implement optional helpers mentioned in AC-8 (modal helper, keyboard helper, test data factories)
  - Coverage threshold enforcement (#4) should be enabled AFTER tests are written
  - @dnd-kit research is already documented in story as implementation research item

kb_status: "unavailable - will create DEFERRED-KB-WRITES.yaml as fallback"
