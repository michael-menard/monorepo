findings: []

pre_existing_issues:
  - "react-hook-form version mismatch in MocEdit/EditForm.tsx (7.66.1 vs 7.71.1)"
  - "FeatureSchema export renamed to MocFeatureSchema in @repo/api-client"
  - "Unused variables in @repo/api-client wishlist-api.ts"

summary: "BUGF-002 implementation is correct, follows the CreateMocPage.tsx pattern exactly, and passes all 27 unit tests. Pre-existing build issues in the app-instructions-gallery package prevent full type-check and E2E testing."
