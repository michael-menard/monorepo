# Calculation Details

## AC Count Analysis
- AC count: 22
- Complexity: complex (>= 5 ACs)
- Base split risk from AC count: 0.5 (high AC count)

## Scope Complexity Analysis
- Scope keywords: frontend, testing, auth, navigation, mocking
- Frontend + backend: No (frontend only)
- Database: No
- Auth keywords: Yes (+0.1 split risk)
- Test infrastructure: Yes (testing focus)

## Split Risk Calculation
- Base risk: 0.5 (from 22 ACs)
- Auth complexity boost: +0.1
- Test infrastructure complexity: +0.1
- **Final split_risk: 0.7**

## Review Cycles Calculation
- Base cycles: 1
- Scope keywords > 3: Yes (+1 cycle)
- Auth/security: Yes (+1 cycle)
- Estimated files > 5: Yes, 11 test suites (+0 additional, already counted)
- **Final review_cycles: 3**

## Token Estimate Calculation
- WKFL-006 patterns: Unavailable
- KB similar stories: None found (heuristics-only mode)
- Fallback: Story complexity heuristic
  - Complex story (22 ACs): baseline 150K
  - Test infrastructure focus: +20K (comprehensive test updates)
  - Multiple test suites (11): +10K
- **Final token_estimate: 180000**

## Confidence Assessment
- Similar stories: 0 (no KB data)
- WKFL-006 patterns: Unavailable
- **Confidence: low** (heuristics-only mode, no historical data)

## Notes
- Predictions generated in degraded mode (no KB access, no WKFL-006 patterns)
- Split risk is high due to:
  1. Large AC count (22 ACs)
  2. Auth-related work (complex mocking)
  3. Unknown extent of RTK Query refactoring impact
  4. Hub.listen mocking blocker
- Review cycles estimate based on:
  1. Multiple test suites requiring investigation
  2. Auth complexity requiring security review
  3. Coordination with active refactoring work
- Token estimate conservative due to:
  1. Investigation phase for each test suite
  2. Potential for iterative mock updates
  3. Documentation requirements for removed tests

## Recommended Actions
- Consider splitting story if Hub.listen solution proves complex (defer to BUGF-010)
- Prioritize high-value test suites (auth flows) over lower priority (performance tests)
- Document decision criteria for fix vs. remove early to guide implementation
- Monitor token usage; if exceeding 150K, consider removing lower priority tests
