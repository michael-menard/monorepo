predictions:
  split_risk:
    score: 0.1
    confidence: high
    reasoning: |
      Story is well-scoped as a security architecture review with clear deliverable (SECURITY-REVIEW.md).
      All 6 ACs are documentation-focused and achievable within 2-3 days.
      No implementation work required, reducing scope creep risk.
      Low split risk.
    
  review_cycles:
    estimate: 2
    confidence: medium
    reasoning: |
      Security reviews typically require peer review and iteration.
      Expected cycle 1: Initial draft
      Expected cycle 2: Security expert feedback incorporation
      Possible cycle 3 if significant gaps identified
      2-3 review cycles estimated.

      Documentation and analysis story.
      Phase 1: Architecture documentation (~3k tokens)
      Phase 2: Threat modeling (~4k tokens)
      Phase 3: Contract spec and vulnerability assessment (~5k tokens)
      Phase 4: Documentation writing (~3k tokens)
      Total: 8k-15k tokens estimated.

    - story_id: BUGF-005
      confidence: high
      notes: Primary blocker removal - security review must be complete before auth hook consolidation

      description: Incomplete security review may provide false confidence for BUGF-005
      mitigation: Require external security consultant review if internal expertise insufficient
    
  fallback_plan: |
    If security review identifies blocking vulnerabilities:
    1. Create follow-up stories to fix identified issues
    2. BUGF-005 remains blocked until mitigations implemented
    3. Update BUGF-005 security acceptance criteria based on findings
    
    If external security consultant unavailable:
    1. Use OWASP ASVS as self-review checklist
    2. Run automated SAST tools for vulnerability detection
    3. Peer review by most senior available engineer
    4. Accept higher risk and document gaps for future review
