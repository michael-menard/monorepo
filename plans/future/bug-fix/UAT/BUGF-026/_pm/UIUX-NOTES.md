# UI/UX Notes: BUGF-026

## Story Type: Security Architecture Review

This is a documentation and security architecture review story. UI/UX considerations are not applicable.

## Documentation Clarity Recommendations

While not traditional UI/UX work, the security review documentation should follow these principles:

1. **Visual Communication:**
   - Include architecture diagrams for token refresh flow
   - Use sequence diagrams to illustrate Hub.listen event flows
   - Create threat model matrix in table format for scanability

2. **Structure and Readability:**
   - Use clear headings and sections
   - Include table of contents for long sections
   - Use bullet points and numbered lists for clarity
   - Highlight security-critical decision points

3. **Developer Experience:**
   - Make auth hook contract specification easy to reference
   - Include code examples for expected patterns
   - Clearly distinguish requirements vs. recommendations

## Deliverable Format

Recommend using Markdown with Mermaid diagrams for architecture flows.

## N/A Reasoning

This is a security architecture review story, not a UI/UX implementation story.
