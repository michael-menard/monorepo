    - title: "Implement skeleton loaders for all gallery views"
      gap: "empty state during initial load feels broken"

  recommendations:
    - "Phase 1 upload stories should include loading state UX specs"
    - "All error messages should provide actionable next steps"
    - "Consider adding undo/retry patterns for destructive operations (BUGF-003 delete, BUGF-023 reorder)"
    - "Form validation should show all errors at once, not one-by-one"
