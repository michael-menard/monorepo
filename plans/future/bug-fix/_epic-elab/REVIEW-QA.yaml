  recommendations:
    - "Phase 1 stories should include integration test specs before implementation starts"
    - "Use MSW handlers as baseline for API mocking in all frontend tests"
    - "Consider Playwright fixture for auth state to reduce test setup boilerplate"
    - "Mandate E2E tests for every user-facing feature per Phase 1/2"
