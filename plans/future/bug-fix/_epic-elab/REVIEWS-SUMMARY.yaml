requires_fixes:
  - "Backend API implementation for presigned URLs (BUGF-001, BUGF-004)"
  - "Test strategy definition for Phase 1 stories (BUGF-001, BUGF-002, BUGF-003)"
  - "Security architecture review for auth hook consolidation (BUGF-005)"
  - "Rate limiting enforcement for password reset (BUGF-008, BUGF-019)"

next_steps:
  1: "Address engineering blockers: coordinate with backend on presigned URL API contract"
  2: "Define test strategies for Phase 1 stories including unit, integration, and E2E acceptance criteria"
  3: "Conduct security threat modeling for presigned URL implementation"
  4: "Schedule architecture review for BUGF-005 auth hook consolidation"
  5: "Proceed to Phase 2 elaboration once Phase 1 blockers cleared"

aggregated_recommendations:
  - "Phase 1 (BUGF-001, 002, 003) must complete before Phase 2 can start"
  - "Presigned URL endpoint should be feature-flagged for safe rollout"
  - "All Phase 3 test coverage stories should be batched into larger epics"
  - "Consider creating separate security hardening epic after Phase 1 completion"
