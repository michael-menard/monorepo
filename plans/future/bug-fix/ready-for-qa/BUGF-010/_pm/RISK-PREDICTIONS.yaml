# Prediction Rationale

## split_risk: 0.1 (Low)

**Calculation:**
- Base risk from AC count: (12 - 3) * 0.1 = 0.9
- Scope complexity boost: -0.8 (test infrastructure only, no frontend/backend/database changes)
- Final risk: max(0.0, 0.9 - 0.8) = 0.1

**Justification:**
- Test infrastructure stories rarely split
- All tests already written, only mock setup needed
- Clear solution pattern exists in AuthStateSync.integration.test.tsx
- Estimated 2-4 hours of work (per seed)

## review_cycles: 1 (Low Complexity)

**Calculation:**
- Base cycles: 1
- Complexity signals: 0 (test infrastructure, single file change)
- No auth/security changes to production code
- No database changes
- Estimated files: 1-2 (AuthProvider.test.tsx, possibly setup.ts)
- Final: 1 cycle

**Justification:**
- Straightforward test fix with clear solution
- Low risk of requiring rework
- Changes isolated to test file
- No production code changes

## token_estimate: 80000 (Heuristic Fallback)

**Calculation:**
- Similar stories: 0 (KB unavailable or no matches)
- WKFL-006 patterns: unavailable
- Fallback to conservative estimate based on:
  - Test infrastructure stories: typically 50K-100K tokens
  - 8 tests to unskip: ~5K-10K tokens each
  - Investigation and documentation: ~10K-20K tokens
  - Total estimate: 80K tokens

**Justification:**
- No similar stories found in KB (KB may be unavailable)
- Using conservative heuristic for test infrastructure work
- Actual may be lower if solution is straightforward copy from AuthStateSync pattern

## confidence: low

**Justification:**
- No KB access to similar stories
- WKFL-006 patterns unavailable (heuristics-only mode)
- Predictions based purely on AC count and scope keywords
- Actual outcomes may vary significantly

## similar_stories: []

**Reason:**
- KB unavailable or no similar test infrastructure stories with OUTCOME.yaml files
- Cannot provide data-driven predictions
- Fallback to heuristics only

# Notes

- Predictions generated in heuristics-only mode due to missing WKFL-006 patterns
- KB may be unavailable or contain no similar test infrastructure stories
- split_risk intentionally low due to test-only scope (no production code changes)
- token_estimate is conservative fallback; actual may be 50-100K range
- Confidence will improve as KB accumulates test infrastructure story outcomes
