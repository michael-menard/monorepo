summary:
  acs_added: 1

  non_goals_clarified: 1
  kb_entries_deferred: 12
  audit_issues_resolved: 0
  audit_issues_flagged: 0

rationale: |
  ANALYSIS.md showed CONDITIONAL PASS verdict with:
  - All 8 audit checks passing
  - 3 minor issues (Low-Medium severity, non-blocking)
  - No MVP-critical gaps
  - No split required

  Actions taken:
  1. Added AC-4a for explicit performance monitoring validation (addresses Issue #2)
  2. Enhanced Non-Goals to emphasize NOT a bug-fix story (addresses Issue #3)
  3. Added Implementation Notes for AuthProvider path verification (addresses Issue #1)
  4. Deferred 12 non-blocking findings to DEFERRED-KB-WRITES.yaml (many reference existing stories)

  Verdict: PASS
  - All issues resolved with minimal changes
  - Story is ready for implementation
  - No scope expansion required
  - Clear prioritization and exit criteria maintained

next_steps: |
  1. Story ready to move from elaboration to ready-to-work
  2. DEFERRED-KB-WRITES.yaml contains findings for future KB persistence
  3. No split required - story can proceed as-is
  4. Developer should review Implementation Notes before starting work
