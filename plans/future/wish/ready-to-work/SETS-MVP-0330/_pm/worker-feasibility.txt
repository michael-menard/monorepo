This story already has architecture notes and implementation notes. Your job is to provide technical feasibility analysis, complexity estimates, and implementation risks.

SEED CONTEXT:
- Reuse candidates: Sonner toast system, existing auth middleware, RTK Query pattern, Ports & Adapters service layer
- Relevant packages: @repo/app-component-library, @repo/api-client, @repo/api-core, @repo/logger
- Active work: SETS-MVP-0310 (UAT - purchase flow dependency), SETS-MVP-0320 (Backlog - complementary success toast features)
- Constraints: Ports & Adapters pattern, Zod-first types, No barrel files, client-side timer approach

Implementation priorities from seed:
1. Start with backend: Implement unpurchase endpoint first
2. Service layer first: Implement revertPurchase() method
3. Frontend integration: Extend GotItModal toast last

Technical risks from seed:
1. Toast Lifecycle: Verify toast doesn't auto-dismiss before user can click
2. State Synchronization: RTK Query cache invalidation after undo
3. Database Transaction: Ensure status revert is atomic

Estimated complexity: 5-7 hours total (1-point story)
