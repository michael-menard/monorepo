This story already has architecture notes. Your job is to provide UI/UX recommendations focusing on user experience, accessibility, and interaction patterns.

SEED CONTEXT:
- Related components: GotItModal (success toast), BuildStatusToggle (reference undo pattern)
- Reuse candidates: Sonner toast with action buttons, existing 5s duration standard
- Established patterns: Toast action buttons from BuildStatusToggle

UI/UX considerations from seed:
1. Undo Button Visibility: 5-second window may feel short - consider visual countdown
2. Item Re-appearance Position: After undo, item may move to bottom of list
3. Success Message Clarity: "Purchase reverted" vs "Item returned to wishlist"
4. Undo Chain: What if user wants to undo the undo?
5. Mobile Touch Targets: Ensure undo button has sufficient tap target size (44x44px minimum)

Focus on accessibility, mobile usability, and clear user feedback patterns.
