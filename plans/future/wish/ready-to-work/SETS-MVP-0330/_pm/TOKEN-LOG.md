- **Grand Total:** 50,028 tokens

## Breakdown by Activity

- Phase 0: Setup and Load Seed (~5,000 tokens)
- Phase 0.5a: Experiment Variant Assignment (~500 tokens)

## Notes

- Enhanced with seed recommendations and detailed test scenarios
- No worker spawning required (existing story had good coverage)
- Experiment variant assigned: control (no active experiments)
- KB persistence deferred (graceful degradation)
