  enhancements:
    - id: 1
      finding: "Item re-ordering after undo: Item may appear at bottom of list instead of original position"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Low priority - Acceptable UX trade-off for MVP. User understands item moved back to wishlist."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: edge-case
      impact: Low
      effort: Medium

    - id: 2
      finding: "No visual countdown indicator for 5-second undo window"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Users rely on toast auto-dismiss timing. Consider progress bar if analytics show missed undo attempts."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: ux-polish
      impact: Low
      effort: Low

    - id: 3
      finding: "Toast persistence across navigation not explicitly tested"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "E2E test AC7 assumes toast persists. Verify actual Sonner behavior; document if undo is lost on navigation."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: edge-case
      impact: Medium
      effort: Low

    - id: 4
      finding: "No undo notification if user misses 5-second window"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "After toast dismisses, user must manually revert. Consider collection view banner for recent purchases (24h window)."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: ux-polish
      impact: Low
      effort: Low

    - id: 5
      finding: "No server-side time validation creates theoretical security gap"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Acceptable risk for MVP - User can only undo own items due to ownership validation. Add server-side expiry if abuse detected."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: edge-case
      impact: Low
      effort: Medium

    - id: 6
      finding: "Extended undo window (24+ hours) via collection view history"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "High-impact future enhancement. Track undo usage analytics to validate need for longer window beyond toast."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: future-work
      impact: High
      effort: High

    - id: 7
      finding: "Redo functionality (undo the undo)"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "After undo, show 'Redo' action in undo success toast - completes undo/redo pattern."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: enhancement
      impact: Medium
      effort: Medium

    - id: 8
      finding: "Undo history/stack for multiple operations"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Defer to v2 - Requires state management, UI for history list, complex undo chain logic."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: future-work
      impact: Medium
      effort: High

    - id: 9
      finding: "Optimistic UI updates for undo operation"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Quick win - Immediately update UI while backend processes. Reduces perceived latency but adds complexity. Standard RTK Query pattern."
      action: kb_write
      kb_entry_id: null
      category: performance
      impact: Medium
      effort: Low

    - id: 10
      finding: "Analytics tracking: undo usage frequency"
      decision: "KB-logged"
      notes: "Quick win - Track: undo_clicked, undo_succeeded, undo_timeout events. Inform future undo window tuning."

  - "No MVP-critical gaps identified - all core user journey steps have ACs and tests"
  - "Comprehensive test coverage: 6 E2E scenarios + unit tests + integration tests"
  - "Reference pattern exists (BuildStatusToggle) reducing implementation risk"
  - "All non-blocking findings tracked for future iterations"
  - "Story follows Ports & Adapters pattern correctly"
  - "Dependency SETS-MVP-0310 in UAT provides stable foundation"
