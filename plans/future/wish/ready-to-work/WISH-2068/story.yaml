goal: Detect browsers without WebP support and provide graceful fallback to JPEG compression with clear user messaging.
non_goals:
  - Not re-implementing core WebP conversion (handled by WISH-2058)
  - Not implementing lossless WebP compression (lossy is sufficient)
  - Not implementing server-side browser detection (client-side only)
  - Not implementing polyfills or shims for WebP support
