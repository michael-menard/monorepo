verdict: pass
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope matches index entry. Focused on browser detection and fallback logic only, WebP core conversion
      delegated to WISH-2058.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals, Non-goals, ACs, and Test Plan are aligned. Clear preventive + reactive fallback strategy.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Reuses existing imageCompression.ts from WISH-2022, JPEG compression options, toast notification system. No new
      shared packages needed.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Frontend-only story, no API endpoints. Client-side utility functions with browser APIs (canvas).
      Transport-agnostic design.
  local_testability:
    status: conditional
    note: Test plan covers happy path, error cases, edge cases. However, needs clarification on HOW to test Safari 13/IE11
      detection without real browsers.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: No blocking TBDs. Open Questions section states "None - all requirements are clear and non-blocking."
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: Explicitly documents detection accuracy (99%+), user confusion risk, performance overhead (~1ms). All risks are
      acknowledged and mitigated.
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: Only 2 ACs, single package, frontend-only, no endpoints. Well-scoped split story. Estimated 1 point is reasonable.
