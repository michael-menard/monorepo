notes: |
  This is a straightforward configuration-only story that passed all 8 audit checks.

  No MVP-critical gaps were identified. The parent story (WISH-2120) is in UAT status
  with test utilities complete and fully tested at 100% coverage.

  All findings in FUTURE-OPPORTUNITIES.md are non-blocking enhancements that have been
  logged for future reference. KB tools were unavailable, so findings are tracked in
  deferred_kb_writes section above.

  The story establishes a two-tier coverage strategy:
  - Global coverage: 45% (unchanged)
  - Test utilities: 80% (new enforcement)

  This pattern is extensible to other critical paths (hooks, utils, lib) via follow-up
  stories, but those are explicitly out of scope for WISH-20290.

  Story is ready to proceed to completion phase without modifications.
