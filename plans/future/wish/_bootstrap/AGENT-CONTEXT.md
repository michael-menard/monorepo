  # Epic 6: Wishlist Feature

  **Status:** In Progress
  **Story Location:** `plans/future/wish/`

  ---

  ## Epic Goal

  Enable users to track LEGO and alt-brick sets they want to purchase, with a gallery view for easy browsing and a "Got it" flow to transition items to their Sets collection.

  ## Epic Description

  ### Context

  The Wishlist is a purchase tracking tool for LEGO builders. Users add sets they want to buy, track priority and notes, and eventually mark items as purchased (moving them to the Sets Gallery).

  **Key Differentiators from other galleries:**
  - Focused on external products (sets from LEGO.com and other retailers)
  - Images stored in S3 (not hotlinked)
  - "Got it" flow transitions items to Sets Gallery
  - Draggable for manual priority ordering
  - Hard delete (no restore)
