verdict: pass
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: Story correctly acknowledges backend is 100% complete. Frontend-only scope matches stories.index.md. No extra
      endpoints.
  internal_consistency:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: Goals, Non-goals, Decisions, and ACs are internally consistent. Backend verification ACs (1-4) align with frontend
      implementation ACs (5-18).
  reuse-first:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: Story reuses `@repo/app-component-library` AlertDialog and Toast (Sonner). RTK Query patterns from WISH-2001. Undo
      pattern will be shared with WISH-2042.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: "Backend architecture correctly documented with actual `lego-api` hexagonal structure: `application/services.ts`
      (lines 173-184), `routes.ts` (lines 198-210), `adapters/repositories.ts`. Frontend work is properly separated (RTK
      Query mutations)."
  local_testability:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: Backend verification tests exist at `__tests__/services.test.ts` (deleteItem suite lines 183-197). Frontend test
      plan includes component, integration, E2E, and a11y tests. Comprehensive coverage.
  decision_completeness:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: "No blocking TBDs. Undo mechanism fully specified (AC 12-14): store item in component state, restore via
      `addWishlistItem`, handle restoration failures."
  risk_disclosure:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: "Five risks documented with mitigations: race conditions, concurrent deletions, rapid clicks, accessibility gaps,
      data loss on accidental delete. All appropriate."
  story_sizing:
    status: "**pass**"
    note: 18 ACs (4 verification + 14 implementation), single focused flow, frontend-only. Appropriately sized after split
      from WISH-2004. No split required.
gaps:
  - id: GAP-gap_1
    category: requirements
    severity: important
    finding: RTK Query mutation hook export missing
    recommendation: ""
split_required: false
follow_ups:
  - finding: None at this time. WISH-2042 (Purchase Flow) will reuse undo patterns from this story.
