goal: Enable targeted feature flag rollout to specific users through explicit inclusion/exclusion lists, complementing
  the existing percentage-based rollout system.
non_goals:
  - "**Complex targeting rules** (e.g., user attributes, segments, conditions) - simple include/exclude lists only"
  - "**Real-time targeting updates** - rely on existing 5-minute cache TTL"
  - "**Targeting UI** - admin API only (defer UI to future story)"
  - "**Targeting analytics** - defer metrics to future story"
  - "**Third-party targeting services** - in-house implementation only"
  - "**Organization/team-level targeting** - user-level only for MVP"
  - "**Geo-targeting or device-targeting** - user-level only"
