  Code Review for WISH-2070: Fix Pre-existing TypeScript Errors

  VERDICT: PASS - All changes are type-only fixes following CLAUDE.md conventions.

  ## Review Results

  - Code style: PASS (no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas)
  - Type safety: PASS (proper type assertions, no unnecessary `as any`)
  - Runtime behavior: PASS (no logic changes, only type fixes)
  - Security: PASS (no vulnerabilities introduced)
  - Testing: PASS (type-only changes to test files)

  ## Changes Verified

  - @repo/logger .d.ts declarations generated correctly
  - AppToggleGroup changed from interface to type intersection (avoids CSS style conflict)
  - CollectionPage prop types fixed to match component APIs
  - Test files have proper type annotations for mocks and state
  - Unused imports removed across 7 files

  ## Pre-existing Issues (not introduced by this story)

  - 4 test files with 14 failing tests (assertion issues, not type errors)
