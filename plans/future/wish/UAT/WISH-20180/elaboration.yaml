verdict: pass
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope matches stories.index.md exactly. No scope creep detected.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals align with ACs. Non-goals properly exclude future enhancements. Test Plan covers all 20 ACs.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: "Leverages existing tools: Drizzle `_journal.json`, GitHub Actions infrastructure, SQL parsers (pg-query-parser).
      No unnecessary new packages."
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: N/A - This is a CI/tooling story, not an API endpoint. No service layer required. Validation script is a
      standalone tool.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: Comprehensive test plan with 7 test scenarios covering breaking changes, naming conventions, journal validation,
      and CI behavior. All tests are executable locally.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: No TBDs. Open Questions section is empty. All dependencies clear from WISH-2057 parent story.
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "5 risks identified with mitigations: false positives (escape hatch), SQL parsing complexity (fallback), CI
      performance (30s timeout), policy drift (cross-reference tests), developer friction (clear errors)."
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: "20 ACs is at the upper boundary but justified: covers end-to-end CI workflow (5 ACs), migration validation (4
      ACs), breaking changes (5 ACs), non-breaking changes (4 ACs), documentation (2 ACs). All ACs are cohesive and
      belong to single deployment unit. Not a split candidate."
