follow_up_from: WISH-2013
scope:
  packages:
    - apps/api/lego
    - apps/api/lego
    - apps/api/lego
    - apps/web/app
    - apps/web/app
  surfaces:
    - backend
    - frontend
    - infra
goal: Integrate Amazon CloudFront as a CDN to serve wishlist images from edge locations, reducing latency for global
  users and lowering bandwidth costs. Ensure seamless migration from S3 URLs to CloudFront URLs without breaking
  existing images.
non_goals:
  - "**Image Transformations:** On-the-fly resizing, format conversion (WebP), or compression is out of scope for MVP.
    Defer to WISH-2016 (Image Optimization) or future Lambda@Edge story."
  - "**Video/PDF CDN:** This story focuses on image delivery only. Other file types (PDFs, videos) are out of scope."
  - "**Custom Domain:** Using a custom domain (e.g., `cdn.lego-moc.com`) instead of CloudFront's default domain is
    deferred to future branding story."
  - "**Cache Invalidation UI:** Admin UI for manual cache invalidation is out of scope. Use AWS CLI or CloudFormation
    for cache invalidation in MVP."
  - "**Multi-CDN Strategy:** Using multiple CDN providers (Cloudflare, Fastly) for redundancy is out of scope."
