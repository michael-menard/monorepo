scope:
  packages: []
  surfaces:
    - backend
    - frontend
    - infra
goal: Verify and document that all wishlist endpoints enforce proper authorization checks through comprehensive testing
  and security policy documentation, preventing cross-user data access and establishing a foundation for future
  role-based access control.
non_goals:
  - Implementing new authorization features (middleware already exists)
  - Role-based access control (admin users) - deferred to Phase 4
  - Rate limiting or DDoS protection - separate story (WISH-XXXX)
  - OAuth provider integration - out of scope
  - Multi-tenant architecture changes - single-user ownership model sufficient for MVP
  - Frontend authorization checks - API layer enforcement only
  - Historical audit log viewer UI - deferred to Phase 5
  - Penetration testing - manual QA security testing sufficient for MVP
