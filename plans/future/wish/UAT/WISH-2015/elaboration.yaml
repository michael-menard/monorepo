verdict: conditional
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope matches stories.index.md exactly. Follow-up from WISH-2002 for form autosave feature.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals align with Scope. Non-goals clearly exclude server-side storage, cross-device sync, and edit form. AC
      matches scope.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Builds on existing WishlistForm from WISH-2002. Uses browser localStorage API. No unnecessary new packages.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Frontend-only story. No API endpoints. No business logic in adapters. Architecture is clear.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: Playwright E2E test requirement added as AC. Frontend testing fully specified.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: No blocking TBDs. Open Questions section states "None - all requirements are clear and non-blocking."
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "4 risks explicitly documented: localStorage quota, S3 URL expiration, race conditions, privacy. All are
      acceptable tradeoffs."
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: 12 ACs (including new QA additions), frontend-only, single component + hook, 1 page modified. Estimated 2 points
      remains appropriate.
