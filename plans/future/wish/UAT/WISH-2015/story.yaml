title: Form Autosave via RTK Slice with localStorage Persistence
points: 2
priority: null
blocked_by: null
depends_on:
  - WISH-2002
follow_up_from: WISH-2002
scope:
  packages: []
  surfaces:
    - frontend
goal: Automatically save form state during user input and restore it when the user returns to the form, preventing data
  loss from accidental navigation or browser issues. Use RTK as the state management layer with localStorage as the
  persistence backend.
non_goals:
  - Not re-implementing the form submission logic from WISH-2002
  - Not implementing server-side draft storage (RTK slice + localStorage only)
  - Not implementing cross-device draft synchronization
  - Not implementing draft expiration or cleanup (user can manually clear)
  - Not implementing autosave for edit form (edit already loads from server)
  - Not supporting multiple currencies (all prices stored in USD; assumption documented)
  - Not adding redux-persist as a dependency (custom lightweight middleware instead)
