scope:
  packages: []
  surfaces:
    - backend
    - frontend
    - infra
goal: Automatically save form state during user input and restore it when the user returns to the form, preventing data
  loss from accidental navigation or browser issues.
non_goals:
  - Not re-implementing the form submission logic from WISH-2002
  - Not implementing server-side draft storage (using localStorage only)
  - Not implementing cross-device draft synchronization
  - Not implementing draft expiration or cleanup (user can manually clear)
  - Not implementing autosave for edit form (edit already loads from server)
  - Not supporting multiple currencies (all prices stored in USD; assumption documented)
