    status: pass
    note: Goals, Non-goals, Decisions, and ACs are internally consistent. No contradictions found.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Builds on existing WISH-2022 compression logic. Uses established localStorage patterns. No new shared packages
      introduced.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Frontend-only story. No API layer involved. N/A for ports & adapters compliance.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: Specifies Playwright E2E tests for preset selection/persistence and unit tests for compression logic. Tests are
      concrete.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: No blocking TBDs. Open Questions section explicitly states "None - all requirements clear and non-blocking."
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: Risks section covers user confusion, large file outputs, UI clutter, and estimation accuracy. Mitigations provided.
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: "Story is appropriately sized: 14 ACs, frontend-only, extends existing feature, no cross-domain work. 2 story
      points justified."
