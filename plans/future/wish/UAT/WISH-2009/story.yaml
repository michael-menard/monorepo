goal: Enable safe, gradual rollout of wishlist features to users through feature flag infrastructure supporting canary
  deployments and percentage-based rollouts.
non_goals:
  - Third-party feature flag service integration (LaunchDarkly, Flagsmith) - use simple in-house solution
  - Real-time flag updates via WebSocket - poll-based or on-request evaluation only
  - Flag analytics/usage metrics - defer to future story
  - User-level targeting (e.g., specific users) - percentage-based only in MVP
  - Multi-environment flag sync - flags configured per environment
  - Flag audit logging - defer to future story
  - Flag scheduling (scheduled enable/disable) - manual only in MVP
