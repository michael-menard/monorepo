  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Scope matches stories.index.md entry. Story creates shared schemas only, no endpoints or infrastructure.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals align with Non-goals. Story focuses on schema definitions, excludes implementation details.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Creates schemas in shared `@repo/api-client` package for reuse across frontend/backend. No one-off utilities.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Story is schema-only, no endpoint implementation. Backend will import schemas (AC8 confirms).
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: "AC10-12: 20+ unit tests for schema validation. No .http tests needed (schema-only story)."
  decision_completeness:
    status: fail
    note: "Missing decision on schema field drift vs Drizzle database schema (see Issue #1)."
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "Three risks disclosed: circular dependency, schema drift, build order. All have mitigations."
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: 2 points estimated. 14 ACs, schema definitions only. Well-sized for foundation work.
