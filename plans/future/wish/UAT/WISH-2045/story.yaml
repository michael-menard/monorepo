  - WISH-2022

  packages: []
  surfaces:
    - frontend
    - infra
goal: Enable HEIC/HEIF image uploads with automatic conversion to JPEG during the compression workflow, ensuring all
  users can upload iPhone photos with compression benefits.
non_goals:
  - Not implementing native HEIC storage (convert to JPEG for compatibility)
  - Not implementing HEIC display in browsers (rely on JPEG conversion)
  - Not supporting other exotic image formats (focus on HEIC/HEIF only)
  - Not re-implementing the core compression logic from WISH-2022
  - Not implementing server-side HEIC conversion (client-side conversion only for MVP)
