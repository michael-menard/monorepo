  Code Review for WISH-2045 HEIC/HEIF Image Format Support

  VERDICT: PASS - All 6 code review workers passed successfully.

  ## Workers Run
  - lint: PASS (0 errors, 3 warnings on ignored test files - expected)
  - style: PASS (0 errors, no inline styles, Tailwind CSS conventions followed)
  - syntax: PASS (0 errors, modern ES7+ throughout)
  - security: PASS (0 errors, no eval/innerHTML/dangerouslySetInnerHTML/hardcoded credentials)
  - typecheck: PASS (0 errors in touched files, pre-existing errors in unrelated test files)
  - build: PASS (0 errors, production build in 2.87s, heic2any bundled correctly)

  ## Implementation Quality
  - Zod-first typing: HEICConversionResultSchema with z.infer<>
  - Clean separation: conversion logic in utils, integration in hooks
  - No forbidden patterns: no barrel files, no console.log, uses @repo/logger
  - Dependencies properly mocked in test setup

  ## Test Results
  - 116 unit tests passed (65 imageCompression + 51 useS3Upload)
  - 35 new HEIC-specific tests added
  - Coverage: imageCompression.ts 100%, useS3Upload.ts 95.07%
  - Test duration: 2.32s

  ## Pre-existing Issues (not blocking)
  - 4 TypeScript errors in unrelated test files
  - Chunk size warnings in build (pre-existing)
  - act() warnings in async cancel tests (cosmetic)
