verdict: conditional
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope matches stories.index.md entry exactly. No extra endpoints, infrastructure, or features introduced.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals align with Non-goals. All ACs align with scope. Test Plan matches ACs comprehensively.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: QA Discovery Notes show AC16 was added to require explicit evaluation of @repo/accessibility package during
      implementation. Story correctly plans to enhance existing package if needed. Issue resolved.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: No API endpoints planned. Frontend-only testing infrastructure work. No service layer required.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: Story creates test infrastructure itself. Test plan includes 15+ axe-core tests, 10+ keyboard tests, 8+ screen
      reader tests, and integration test patterns.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: No blocking TBDs or unresolved design decisions. Story is focused and well-scoped.
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "Four risks explicitly documented with mitigation strategies: axe-core false positives, keyboard navigation
      brittleness, screen reader mock limitations, and performance overhead."
  story_sizing:
    status: conditional pass
    note: "**15 Acceptance Criteria** (exceeds 8 AC threshold). However, story is focused infrastructure setup with clear
      bounded scope. No multiple independent features bundled. All ACs relate to single goal: accessibility testing
      harness. Touches 1 package primarily. Recommend monitoring during implementation; consider split only if effort
      exceeds 2 points."
