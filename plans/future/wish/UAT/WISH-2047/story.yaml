title: IP/Geolocation Logging for Authorization Events - Phase 5 Observability
points: 2

  - WISH-2008
follow_up_from: WISH-2008
scope:
  packages: []
  surfaces:
    - backend
    - frontend
    - infra
goal: Enrich authorization failure audit logs (403/404 events) with IP address and geolocation data (country, region,
  city) to enable detection of suspicious access patterns, geographic anomalies, and potential security threats through
  CloudWatch Logs Insights queries and monitoring dashboards.
non_goals:
  - Real-time threat detection or automated IP blocking - deferred to future security automation story
  - VPN/proxy detection - out of scope for MVP
  - IP reputation scoring (e.g., checking against threat intelligence feeds) - deferred to Phase 6
  - Historical geolocation analysis dashboard - deferred to Phase 5 audit log viewer UI (WISH-XXXX)
  - GDPR compliance review for IP logging - assumes existing privacy policy covers logging for security purposes
  - IPv6 geolocation (focus on IPv4 for MVP, IPv6 support deferred if needed)
  - ISP/ASN information - country/region/city sufficient for MVP
  - Custom geolocation database updates - use publicly available MaxMind GeoLite2 database
