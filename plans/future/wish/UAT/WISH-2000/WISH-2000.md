# WISH-2000: Database Schema & Types

## Goal

Establish data model foundation for wishlist items with runtime validation and type safety.

## Feature

Drizzle schema for `wishlist_items` table with all PRD fields, Zod schemas in shared package, TypeScript types via `z.infer`.

## Phase

Phase 1: Foundation

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Drizzle schema includes all fields: id, userId, title, store, setNumber, sourceUrl, imageUrl, price, currency, pieceCount, releaseDate, tags, priority, notes, sortOrder, timestamps
- [ ] Zod schemas created: `WishlistItemSchema`, `CreateWishlistItemSchema`, `UpdateWishlistItemSchema`, `WishlistQueryParamsSchema`, `WishlistListResponseSchema`
- [ ] 31+ unit tests for schema validation
- [ ] TypeScript types inferred via `z.infer`

## Risk Notes

Schema must support all PRD fields; changes after migration are costly.

## Technical Details

### Database Schema

**Location:** `apps/api/core/database/schema/wishlist.ts`

Table: `wishlist_items`

| Column | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|---------|-------|
| id | UUID | Yes | random | Primary key |
| userId | text | Yes | — | Foreign key to users |
| title | text | Yes | — | Item name |
| store | text | Yes | — | LEGO, Barweer, Cata, BrickLink, Other |
| setNumber | text | No | — | Set identification |
| sourceUrl | text | No | — | URL where item was found |
| imageUrl | text | No | — | S3 URL for image |
| price | decimal(10,2) | No | — | Item cost |
| currency | text | No | USD | Currency code |
| pieceCount | integer | No | — | Number of pieces |
| releaseDate | timestamp | No | — | Release date |
| tags | text[] | No | [] | User-defined tags |
| priority | integer | No | 0 | Priority level 0-5 |
| notes | text | No | — | User notes |
| sortOrder | integer | No | 0 | Manual sort order |
| createdAt | timestamp | Yes | now | Creation timestamp |
| updatedAt | timestamp | Yes | now | Update timestamp |

**Indexes:**
- Primary key: `id`
- User query: `(userId, createdAt DESC)`
- Sorting: `(userId, sortOrder)`

### Zod Schemas

**Location:** `packages/core/api-client/src/schemas/wishlist.ts`

Required schemas:
1. `WishlistItemSchema` - Full item with all fields
2. `CreateWishlistItemSchema` - Required fields for creation
3. `UpdateWishlistItemSchema` - Partial update fields
4. `WishlistQueryParamsSchema` - Query filters and pagination
5. `WishlistListResponseSchema` - Paginated list response

### Test Coverage

Minimum 31 test cases covering:
- Field validation (required vs optional)
- Type coercion
- Default values
- Array handling (tags)
- Timestamp formats
- Numeric ranges (price, priority, piece count)
- String length constraints
- Enum validation (store, currency)

## Dependencies

None - this is foundation work.

## Reuse Plan

- Use existing Drizzle patterns from `apps/api/core/database/schema`
- Follow Zod schema structure from other epics (Sets, Instructions)
- No per-story one-off utilities

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Drizzle schema file created and compiles
- [ ] Zod schemas created with correct types
- [ ] All 31+ tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Ready for WISH-2007

### Gaps Identified

| # | Finding | User Decision | Notes |
|---|---------|---------------|-------|
| gap_1_schema_validation_tests | No schema validation tests (Drizzle schema compile/export tests) | **Add as AC** | Tests should verify DB schema compiles, exports correctly, and indexes are created. |
| gap_2_schema_zod_alignment | No test for schema<>Zod alignment | **Add as AC** | Integration test to ensure Drizzle schema fields map to Zod schema fields correctly. |
| gap_3_large_decimal_values | Missing edge case: very large decimal values | **Add as AC** | Test price field with values like 999999.99 to ensure precision maintained. Note: implementation uses text field, not decimal. |
| gap_4_tags_array_handling | No test for tags array handling in DB | **Add as AC** | Verify jsonb array serialization/deserialization for tags field. |
| gap_5_sortorder_conflicts | Missing test: sortOrder conflicts | **Add as AC** | Test behavior when multiple items have same sortOrder value. |
| gap_6_userid_source | No documentation for userId source | **Out-of-scope** | userId comes from Cognito JWT - authentication/authorization responsibility. |
| gap_7_timezone_handling | Release date timezone handling | **Out-of-scope** | Timezone handling is client-side display concern, UTC storage is standard. |
| gap_8_enum_validation_db | No test for enum validation at DB level | **Add as AC** | Test that store field enum values are enforced (either via pgEnum or constraint). |

### Enhancement Opportunities

| # | Finding | User Decision | Notes |
|---|---------|---------------|-------|
| enh_1_db_enum_store | Add DB-level enum constraint for store field | **Add as AC** | Consider using pgEnum for store field to prevent invalid values at DB level. |
| enh_2_priority_check_constraint | Add check constraint for priority range (0-5) | **Add as AC** | Add DB constraint `CHECK (priority >= 0 AND priority <= 5)`. |
| enh_3_ts_types_from_drizzle | Generate TypeScript types from Drizzle schema | **Out-of-scope** | Project policy: only Zod types, never derive TS types independently. |
| enh_4_composite_index | Add composite index for common queries | **Add as AC** | Index for (userId, store, priority) used by gallery filtering. |
| enh_5_schema_evolution_docs | Document schema evolution strategy | **Add as AC** | Document post-WISH-2007 schema migration and backward compatibility approach. |
| enh_6_seed_data | Add seed data generation | **Add as AC** | Create seed data factory for local dev/testing. Helpful for WISH-2001 and later stories. |
| enh_7_soft_delete | Consider soft delete pattern | **Out-of-scope** | Deferring soft delete and "undo" to WISH-2004 design phase. |
| enh_8_audit_fields | Add created_by/updated_by audit fields | **Add as AC** | Track which user created/modified items. Useful for multi-user accounts. |

### Follow-up Stories Suggested

- [ ] Schema evolution and migration test suite (post-WISH-2007 deployment)
- [ ] Audit logging infrastructure for wishlist changes (created_by/updated_by)
- [ ] Soft delete implementation and "undo" recovery (WISH-2004 design)

### Items Marked Out-of-Scope

- **gap_6_userid_source**: userId comes from Cognito JWT - handled by authentication layer, not schema validation.
- **gap_7_timezone_handling**: UTC timestamp storage with client-side display conversion is standard practice.
- **enh_3_ts_types_from_drizzle**: Project policy requires Zod-first types only. TypeScript types derived from Zod via `z.infer<>`.
