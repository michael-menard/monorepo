verdict: pass
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: Story scope matches stories.index.md exactly. Frontend-only accessibility enhancements with no scope creep.
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals align with AC, non-goals properly exclude advanced features. Test plan covers all AC.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Acknowledges existing @repo/accessibility package. Story correctly creates app-local utilities first, with plan to
      migrate to shared package later. Uses Radix Dialog focus trap from @repo/ui.
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: No API changes. Frontend-only story doesn't require hexagonal architecture compliance.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: Playwright E2E tests specified. Unit tests for hooks. axe-core integration. Manual screen reader testing (best
      effort).
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: All findings addressed through user decisions (see below). Grid detection strategy and keyboard shortcut scope
      clarified.
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: "All major risks disclosed: grid complexity, focus return, shortcut conflicts, screen reader testing coverage,
      dynamic modal content. Mitigations specified for each."
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: "7 indicators checked: 7 AC sections (acceptable), 0 endpoints, frontend-only (not both layers), single feature,
      reasonable test scenarios, 1 package touched. Story is appropriately sized for accessibility work."
