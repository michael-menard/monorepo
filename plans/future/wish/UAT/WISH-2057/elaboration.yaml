verdict: conditional
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: "Scope matches stories.index entry exactly: 4 documentation files with 20 ACs. No infrastructure or code
      implementation included."
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals/Non-goals/ACs align. Policy docs support governance, versioning strategy, and runbooks for safe schema
      evolution. Test Plan verifies all documentation deliverables.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: Builds on existing Drizzle migration system (`drizzle.config.ts`, `_journal.json`). References industry standards
      (GitHub gh-ost, Stripe, Rails). Leverages existing migration naming pattern (0000-0007).
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Documentation-only story. No API endpoints, services, or adapters involved. Not applicable to this story.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: Test Plan includes 6 concrete verification tests (Policy Completeness, Enum Runbook Walkthrough, Versioning
      Strategy Coherence, Scenarios Coverage, Approval Process, Backward Compatibility Policy). AC requirements are
      testable via documentation review.
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: No blocking TBDs. Architecture Notes document proposed `schema_versions` table design and breaking vs non-breaking
      change definitions. All documentation deliverables clearly scoped.
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: 3 MVP-Critical risks identified with mitigations (incomplete policy leading to breaking changes, enum immutability
      misunderstanding, production downtime from schema locks). 2 Non-MVP risks documented (versioning overhead, schema
      drift).
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: "20 ACs is high but justified for comprehensive policy documentation. Story is documentation-only (no code),
      estimated at 2 points. Work is cohesive: all 4 docs establish schema evolution governance before any modifications
      occur. Each doc serves distinct purpose. Not recommended for split."
