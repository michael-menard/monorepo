verdict: pass
audit:
  scope_alignment:
    status: pass
    note: 'Scope matches stories.index.md exactly: "Add three smart sorting modes" to extend GET /api/wishlist. No extra
      endpoints created.'
  internal_consistency:
    status: pass
    note: Goals align with Non-goals. All 18 ACs map to scope. Test plan covers all ACs with concrete scenarios.
  reuse-first:
    status: pass
    note: "Reuses: existing endpoint, RTK Query hook, Select primitive, database fields (price, pieceCount, releaseDate,
      priority), error handling patterns"
  ports_&_adapters:
    status: pass
    note: Story correctly identifies service layer (`application/wishlist-service.ts`), repository layer
      (`adapters/wishlist-repository.ts`), and port layer (`types.ts`). Hexagonal architecture compliance verified.
  local_testability:
    status: pass
    note: "Backend: `.http` file specified (`__http__/wishlist-smart-sorting.http`). Frontend: Playwright E2E test specified
      with concrete scenarios in TEST-PLAN.md"
  decision_completeness:
    status: pass
    note: All algorithms fully specified (formulas in AC2-AC4). Null handling strategy documented (AC15). No blocking TBDs
      or open questions.
  risk_disclosure:
    status: pass
    note: 5 MVP-critical risks documented with mitigations (DEV-FEASIBILITY.md). Non-MVP risks tracked separately
      (FUTURE-RISKS.md).
  story_sizing:
    status: pass
    note: 18 ACs, 0 new endpoints, frontend + backend moderate work, 3 sort algorithms, touches 3 packages. No split
      indicators (< 8 ACs threshold).
