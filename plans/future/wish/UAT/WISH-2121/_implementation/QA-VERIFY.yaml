# Next Steps for QA Verification
next_phase: qa-verification
verification_gates:
  - Verify all 23 acceptance criteria are correctly implemented
  - Validate E2E test scenarios run correctly in Playwright
  - Confirm MSW fixtures are properly integrated
  - Check documentation completeness
  - Verify no regressions in existing tests

notes: |
  Setup complete. Story ready for QA verification phase.

  Key observations from review:
  - All 23 ACs passing
  - 2 ACs marked as "already_exists" (pre-existing MSW setup reused)
  - 21 ACs actively implemented
  - E2E gate exempt (infrastructure story)
  - Pre-existing TS errors noted but not from WISH-2121

  QA should focus on:
  1. MSW worker lifecycle in browser context
  2. Error injection mechanics
  3. Test isolation guarantees
  4. Documentation accuracy
