goal: Implement optimistic UI for wishlist item creation to provide immediate feedback and navigation, with graceful
  rollback on failure.
non_goals:
  - Not re-implementing the form validation from WISH-2002
  - Not implementing optimistic updates for edit operations (edit is less latency-sensitive)
  - Not implementing optimistic updates for delete operations (delete needs explicit confirmation)
  - Not implementing offline support or request queuing
  - Not implementing retry logic beyond RTK Query defaults
