rationale: |
  All 8 audit checks passed with no MVP-critical gaps identified.
  Story is ready for implementation with comprehensive ACs, test plan, and feasibility review.

  18 non-blocking findings (6 gaps + 12 enhancements) deferred to KB for future iterations.
  These include high-value enhancements like visual dashboard (WKFL-008-C), power analysis (WKFL-008-D),
  real-time monitoring (WKFL-008-E), and pattern-driven experiments (WKFL-008-F).

  No changes required to story.yaml - all ACs are complete and sufficient for MVP.

  Story demonstrates excellent quality:
  - Complete scope alignment with stories.index.md
  - Reuses OUTCOME.yaml, KB tools, statistical patterns from WKFL-002
  - Ports & Adapters architecture (transport-agnostic)
  - Comprehensive test plan (32 test cases)
  - All TBDs resolved with clear implementation notes
  - MVP-critical risks documented with mitigation strategies

kb_status: deferred
kb_deferred_reason: "KB writes deferred to DEFERRED-KB-WRITE.yaml for batch processing"
