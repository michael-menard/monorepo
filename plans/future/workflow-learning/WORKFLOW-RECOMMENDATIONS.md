## Overview

This file is auto-generated by the `/workflow-retro` command. It aggregates workflow improvement proposals based on patterns detected across completed stories.

**How this works:**
1. Stories generate `OUTCOME.yaml` after completion (via dev-documentation-leader)
2. `/workflow-retro` analyzes outcomes and detects patterns
3. Significant patterns (meeting thresholds) are logged to Knowledge Base
4. All proposals are aggregated here for human review

---

## High Priority

_No high priority patterns detected yet._

Run `/workflow-retro --batch` after completing several stories to detect patterns.

---

## Medium Priority

_No medium priority patterns detected yet._

---

## Low Priority / Observations

_No observations yet._

---

## KB Entries Created

| Entry | Pattern | Tags |
|-------|---------|------|
| _None yet_ | — | — |

---

## Next Steps

1. Complete stories through the full workflow (pm-story → qa-gate)
2. Run `/workflow-retro {STORY_ID}` after each completion
3. Run `/workflow-retro --batch` periodically for cross-story analysis
4. Review proposals and create stories for approved changes

## Pattern Detection Thresholds

| Pattern Type | Minimum Occurrences | Minimum Variance |
|--------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Token overrun | 3 stories | 20% |
| Review failure | 3 stories | N/A |
| Agent correlation | 3 stories | 60% |
| AC failure rate | 3 stories | 40% |
