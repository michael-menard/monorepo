review_notes: |
  All 7 acceptance criteria satisfied:
  - AC-1: CalibrationEntrySchema with all required fields, 25 unit tests passing
  - AC-2: Feedback integration with outcome mapping in feedback.md Step 5b
  - AC-3: Accuracy computation per (agent_id, confidence_level) in agent Phase 3
  - AC-4: Alert logic for high confidence < 90% with 10+ sample minimum
  - AC-5: Conceptual threshold recommendations (per ARCH-WKFL-002-002)
  - AC-6: /calibration-report command with --since and --agent args
  - AC-7: Agent frontmatter specifies model: haiku, type: worker

  Schema design is clean:
  - Separate ConfidenceLevelSchema and ActualOutcomeSchema for reuse
  - CalibrationEntrySchema uses .min(1) for flexible ID validation
  - 'calibration' added to KnowledgeEntryTypeSchema enum
  - No tool handler changes needed (generic validation via enum)

  Agent design follows established patterns:
  - Frontmatter matches workflow-retro.agent.md structure
  - KB integration documented with query/write patterns
  - Error handling and fallback behavior specified
  - Non-negotiables enforced (read-only, proposals only)

  No regressions:
  - 25 new calibration tests pass
  - 122 existing schema tests pass
  - 3 pre-existing failures in story-schemas (Zod v4 compat, unrelated)

gate:
  decision: PASS
  reason: "All 7 ACs satisfied, 25 tests passing, no regressions, clean architecture"
