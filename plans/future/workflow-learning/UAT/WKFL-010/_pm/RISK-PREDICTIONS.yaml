  rationale: |
    Split risk (0.6): Medium-high due to:
    - 5 acceptance criteria (moderate complexity)
    - Multi-source aggregation (calibration + patterns + heuristics + retro)
    - KB schema extension required
    - Deduplication logic complexity

    Review cycles (3): Expected 3 iterations due to:
    - Complex ROI calculation logic
    - Multi-source orchestration with Promise.allSettled()
    - Proposal schema design (needs KB schema validation)
    - Meta-learning implementation (acceptance pattern tracking)

    Token estimate (60K): Based on similar stories:
    - WKFL-002 (calibration): 42K tokens
    - WKFL-007 (risk predictor): 48K tokens
    - WKFL-006 (pattern miner): unknown (in QA)
    - Adjustment: +15K for meta-learning complexity and deduplication logic
    - Conservative estimate: 60K (higher than WKFL-007 due to additional meta-learning)

    Confidence (medium): 2 similar stories with actuals, 1 similar story pending completion
