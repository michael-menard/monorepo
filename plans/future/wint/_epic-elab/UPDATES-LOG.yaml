notes: |
  All acceptance criteria updates successfully applied to stories.index.md.

  The updates implement the Phase 3 Interactive decision strategy to resolve
  MVP-critical blockers through explicit acceptance criteria in Phase 0 work items:

  1. SECURITY-BLOCKER-001: RBAC documentation requirement in WINT-0110
  2. SECURITY-BLOCKER-002: Input validation requirements in WINT-0130, WINT-0140
  3. PLATFORM-BLOCKER-001: Rollback testing requirement in WINT-1010
  4. QA-BLOCKER-001: Test suite requirements in WINT-1050, WINT-1060

  This approach keeps the epic unblocked while ensuring Phase 0 delivers
  all prerequisite work required for Phase 1 execution.
