aggregation_notes: |
  **Consensus Findings:**
  - All 6 perspectives agree: READY verdict with manageable risks
  - Core journey supported across all user archetypes (PM, Dev, QA, Ops)
  - Technical foundation sound: PostgreSQL, MCP, TypeScript, familiar patterns
  - Incremental rollout strategy with compatibility shim effectively reduces blast radius

  **Key Conflicts Resolved:**
  - Performance targets (<100ms for story queries, <500ms for cache) set by Engineering + QA
  - ML training data accumulation (30-50 stories) is post-Phase-1 dependency, not blocking MVP
  - Telemetry volume scaling concerns (Platform) mitigated by batching strategy, indexed queries

  **MVP-Critical Items (4 total):**
  - All 4 are Phase 0 prerequisite work items, NOT blocking the epic itself
  - Phase 0 explicitly designed to address security (RBAC, input validation) and reliability (migration rollback)
  - QA requires test infrastructure setup - covered by WINT-0120 (test harness)

  **Non-MVP Deferred Items (15 total):**
  - Post-Phase-4 platform improvements: Redis caching layer, read replicas
  - Post-Phase-5 ML enhancements: Model serving infrastructure, signature verification
  - Post-Phase-7 UI/UX: Dashboard, cohesion rule explorer, preference explainer
  - All deferred items tracked in FUTURE-ROADMAP.yaml

  **Effort & Timeline Alignment:**
  - Engineering: 2-3 weeks Phase 0, 3-4 weeks Phase 1
  - Platform: Minimal infrastructure changes, incremental deployment per phase
  - QA: Test strategy complete, coverage defined for all 8 phases
  - Security: Medium-risk mitigable with Phase 0 hardening, no high-severity vulnerabilities

  **Next Actions for Phase 1 Go-Live:**
  1. Finalize Phase 0 database schema design with Platform team ✓ (ready)
  2. Implement database RBAC strategy with documented role assignments (Phase 0)
  3. Create comprehensive migration script with pre-tested rollback (Phase 0)
  4. Establish CI/CD for Phase 0 schema testing and Phase 1 agent migrations (Phase 0)
  5. Validate compatibility shim with integration test suite (Phase 1 gate: WINT-1080)
