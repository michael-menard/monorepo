notes: |
  **Rationale for Auto-Resolution:**
  The 4 blockers identified in Phase 2 (QA, Security x2, Platform) are not blocking the epic
  itself but rather Phase 0 prerequisites. They are best addressed through explicit acceptance
  criteria in the affected stories:

  - QA-BLOCKER-001: Test infrastructure is part of WINT-1050/1060 scope
  - SECURITY-BLOCKER-001: RBAC strategy is part of WINT-0110 Phase 0 design
  - SECURITY-BLOCKER-002: Input validation is explicit requirement in WINT-0130/0140
  - PLATFORM-BLOCKER-001: Migration rollback is Phase 0 prerequisite for WINT-1010

  This approach keeps the epic unblocked while ensuring Phase 0 delivers all
  prerequisite work required for successful Phase 1 execution.
