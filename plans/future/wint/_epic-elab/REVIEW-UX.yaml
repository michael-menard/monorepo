perspective: ux
verdict: READY
core_flow:
  complete: true
  usable: true
core_user_journeys:
  pm_story_creation:
    steps:
      - Bootstrap epic with database schemas (Phase 0)
      - Stories tracked in database with single source of truth (Phase 1)
      - Cohesion checks identify incomplete features (Phase 4)
    usability: Core journey supported, clear workflow progression
  dev_story_implementation:
    steps:
      - Query story status from database (Phase 1)
      - Access cached context to reduce context loading (Phase 2)
      - View telemetry for decisions and outcomes (Phase 3)
      - Receive ML predictions for model selection (Phase 5)
      - Optionally process multiple stories in batch (Phase 6)
    usability: Clear progression, information architecture sound
  qa_story_verification:
    steps:
      - Query story status and acceptance criteria (Phase 1)
      - Run cohesion checks on completed features (Phase 4)
      - Review telemetry logs of decisions (Phase 3)
      - View quality predictions before approval (Phase 5)
    usability: Story verification supported, data accessible
  ops_workflow_monitoring:
    steps:
      - View phase completion status in database (Phase 1)
      - Monitor batch processing progress (Phase 6)
      - Generate weekly reports of workflow performance (Phase 6)
    usability: Monitoring information available, limited UI
information_architecture:
  database_schema:
    navigation: SQL queries expose core, context_cache, telemetry, graph, workflow schemas
    discoverability: MCP tools provide structured access
    clarity: Schema names and tool names clearly indicate purpose
  command_interface:
    story_status: Query story state
    story_update: Modify story state
    story_move: Change story phase
    telemetry: View invocation logs
    cohesion_check: Detect incomplete features
    batch_process: Run multi-story workflows
    clarity: Commands map clearly to workflows
  agent_interfaces:
    compatibility_shim: Transparent fallback from DB to directory
    ml_predictions: Auto-accept with confidence display
    batch_coordinator: Status visible during processing
    clarity: Agent behaviors understandable through outputs
accessibility:
  database_queries:
    assessment: Accessible via MCP tools and SQL
    concern: SQL knowledge required for custom queries
    mitigation: Pre-built commands cover common scenarios
  ml_auto_accept:
    assessment: Confidence scores provided for predictions
    concern: Users may not understand ML model reasoning
    mitigation: Show confidence and allow override
  batch_processing:
    assessment: Progress visible via batch-status command
    concern: Limited real-time feedback
    mitigation: Summary reports after completion
  navigation:
    assessment: File-based system migrated to database
    concern: Users accustomed to directory structure lose visual navigation
    mitigation: Flat /stories/ directory provides continuity
information_visualization:
  current_state:
    - stories.index.md (generated from database)
    - telemetry command (query results)
    - batch-status command (progress report)
    - weekly-report command (analysis and recommendations)
  clarity: Basic text-based reporting, sufficient for current needs
  future_enhancement: Dashboard UI could improve visibility (Phase 7+)
user_education:
  phases_0_1:
    learning_curve: Moderate - database schema introduction
    mitigation: Clear documentation, migration guide
  phases_2_3:
    learning_curve: Low - context cache transparent to users
    mitigation: Automated telemetry collection
  phases_4_5:
    learning_curve: Moderate - new cohesion checks and ML predictions
    mitigation: Confidence scores, ability to override
  phases_6_7:
    learning_curve: Low - batch processing is convenience feature
    mitigation: Clear batch commands and status reporting
error_handling:
  database_unavailable:
    current: Compatibility shim falls back to directory
    risk: Users may not know which source is active
    mitigation: Document fallback behavior clearly
  ml_prediction_unavailable:
    current: Phase 5 tools gracefully degrade (cold start)
    risk: Users see different behavior during rollout
    mitigation: Show "model not ready yet" message
  cohesion_rule_violations:
    current: Graph checker provides feedback
    concern: Users may not understand rules
    mitigation: Clear rule documentation
future:
  ux_polish:
    - story: WINT-6070
      suggestion: "Weekly report command could highlight actionable improvements"
      impact: medium
  accessibility_improvements:
    - story: WINT-3050, WINT-6070
      suggestion: "Add query templates for common telemetry questions"
      impact: medium
  suggested_stories:
    - title: "Dashboard UI for batch processing status"
      gap: "Current text-based batch-status lacks visibility"
      priority: P2
    - title: "Interactive cohesion rule explorer"
      gap: "Users don't understand why features marked incomplete"
      priority: P2
    - title: "Preference prediction explainer"
      gap: "Users should understand why ML auto-accepts stories"
      priority: P2
  recommendations:
    - "Maintain clear documentation of single source of truth concept"
    - "Show database query results with context (not just raw data)"
    - "Provide clear status indicators during batch processing"
    - "Document all ML predictions with confidence and reasoning"
