core_value_proposition:
  vision: Single source of truth in database enables intelligent automation
  user_journeys:
    - pm: Bootstrap epic with schema setup, enable story tracking
    - dev: Implement stories with database status queries
    - qa: Verify stories with cohesion checks and telemetry
    - ops: Monitor workflows with phase tracking
  completeness: All critical phases address MVP user needs
phase_alignment:
  phase_0: Infrastructure foundation (database, MCP, doc-sync)
  phase_1: Single source of truth (story flattening, DB queries)
  phase_2: Token efficiency (context cache)
  phase_3: Observability (telemetry logging)
  phase_4: Completeness detection (graph cohesion)
  phase_5: Smart automation (ML predictions)
  phase_6: Batch efficiency (unattended processing)
  phase_7: Clean migration (all agents migrated)
story_count_by_phase:
  phase_0: 17 stories (bootstrap infrastructure)
  phase_1: 8 stories (foundation)
  phase_2: 10 stories (context cache)
  phase_3: 7 stories (telemetry)
  phase_4: 11 stories (graph and cohesion)
  phase_5: 14 stories (ML pipeline)
  phase_6: 9 stories (batch mode)
  phase_7: 13 stories (migration)
  total: 88 stories
dependencies:
  forward_critical:
    - Phase 0 blocks all subsequent phases
    - Phase 1 (single source of truth) enables Phase 2-7
    - Phase 3 (telemetry) enables Phase 5 (ML)
  cross_phase:
    - Migration (Phase 7) depends on all prior phases working
    - Batch mode (Phase 6) requires caching, telemetry, cohesion
roadmap_validation: true
success_criteria:
  - Database single source of truth operational
  - All agents migrated from directory to DB queries
  - 80% token reduction achieved
  - ML models trained with 85%+ accuracy
  - 5-10 stories processable in batch mode
  - Zero directory references in agent code

  value_improvements:
    - story: Multiple (Phase 2-5)
      suggestion: "Incremental rollout of caching and ML to high-volume agents"
      impact: high
    - story: WINT-2100, WINT-5130
      suggestion: "Measure and optimize token reduction targets before/after each phase"
      impact: high
  suggested_stories:
    - title: "Performance benchmarking across database sizes"
      user_journey: "Ops needs confidence in scalability"

      user_journey: "Finance needs ROI on ML pipeline"
      priority: P2
  recommendations:
    - "Prioritize Phase 1 (single source of truth) - unblocks all downstream value"
    - "Validate Phase 0 infrastructure thoroughly before Phase 1 work starts"
    - "Build community buy-in for agent migrations in Phase 7"
