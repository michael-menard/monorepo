key_findings:
  strengths:
    - Well-structured 8-phase roadmap with clear dependencies
    - Single source of truth in database solves critical pain point
    - Incremental rollout strategy with compatibility shim reduces risk
    - Comprehensive scope covers infrastructure, observability, learning, and migration
    - All core user journeys supported (PM, Dev, QA, Ops)
  areas_requiring_attention:
    - Database RBAC and authorization strategy needs documentation (Security)
    - Input validation for MCP tools must be explicitly required (Security)
    - Performance benchmarking needed for Phase 1 (<100ms latency target)
    - ML training requires 30-50 stories of telemetry data (Phase 5 dependency)
    - Database schema migration rollback procedure must be pre-tested (Platform)
  recommendations:
    - Prioritize Phase 1 (Foundation) - unblocks all downstream value
    - Establish test infrastructure for Phase 0 schema work
    - Define database access control policy before Phase 0 implementation
    - Create comprehensive Phase 0 migration script with rollback
    - Document compatibility shim behavior thoroughly for Phase 1 rollout
critical_path:
  phase_0: Bootstrap infrastructure (17 stories) - No dependencies, can start immediately
  phase_1: Single source of truth (8 stories) - Depends on Phase 0, unblocks all subsequent phases
  phase_2_5: Context cache, telemetry, graph, ML (42 stories) - Can proceed in parallel after Phase 1
  phase_6: Batch mode (9 stories) - Depends on Phases 2-4, improves ops efficiency
  phase_7: Migration (13 stories) - Final cleanup, depends on all prior phases
risk_assessment:
  technical_risk: LOW
    - All technologies proven and available
    - Familiar patterns (PostgreSQL, MCP, agents)
    - Incremental approach reduces blast radius
  schedule_risk: MEDIUM
    - ML training data accumulation (Phase 5) adds timeline dependency
    - Large number of agents to migrate (Phase 7) could take time
  operational_risk: MEDIUM
    - Compatibility shim adds complexity during Phase 1
    - Database migration requires careful execution
    - Telemetry volume growth could impact performance
  security_risk: MEDIUM
    - RBAC strategy and input validation must be implemented (Phase 0)
    - Telemetry data sensitivity not yet classified
  mitigation: Comprehensive phase gate validation (WINT-1080, WINT-3070, WINT-6090, WINT-7110)
estimated_effort:
  phase_0: 2-3 weeks (manual setup, heavy documentation)
  phase_1: 3-4 weeks (data migration, agent updates)
  phase_2: 2 weeks (cache implementation)
  phase_3: 2 weeks (telemetry integration)
  phase_4: 2-3 weeks (graph and cohesion)
  phase_5: 3-4 weeks (ML pipeline training and integration)
  phase_6: 1-2 weeks (batch mode)
  phase_7: 4-6 weeks (52 agents × testing)
  total: 20-26 weeks (5-6 months)
success_metrics:
  phase_1: Single source of truth operational, all story queries via DB
  phase_2: 80% token reduction achieved
  phase_3: Full telemetry collection with 100% completeness
  phase_4: Cohesion checks detecting all known franken-features
  phase_5: ML models at 85%+ accuracy
  phase_6: 5-10 stories processable in batch mode
  phase_7: Zero directory references, all agents migrated
next_steps:
  immediate:
    - Review Phase 0 database schema design with Platform team
    - Plan Phase 0 infrastructure (migrations, testing environment)
    - Document RBAC strategy and security requirements
  week_1:
    - Finalize Phase 0 stories and acceptance criteria
    - Create database migration script and rollback plan
    - Set up CI/CD for Phase 0 testing
  week_2:
    - Begin Phase 0 bootstrap (schema creation, MCP tools)
    - Implement doc-sync skill and validate
  week_3:
    - Complete Phase 0 validation (WINT-0170)
    - Prepare Phase 1 kickoff (flatten directories, compatibility shim)
