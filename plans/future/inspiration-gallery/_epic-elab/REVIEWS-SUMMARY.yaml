summary:
  overall_verdict: "READY with CONCERNS"
  decision_rationale: "Epic is architecturally sound for Phase 1-2. Engineering has specific concerns around DAG cycle detection and multi-file upload handling. QA identified missing test stories critical for reliability. All perspectives aligned on feature readiness."

key_findings:
  engineering:
    verdict: "CONCERNS"
    primary_issues:
      - "DAG cycle detection algorithm not yet specified - blocks INSP-007"
      - "Multi-file upload error handling requires detailed retry strategy"
      - "Drag-and-drop library (dnd-kit) unfamiliar to team - learning curve"
    critical_actions:
      - "Specify cycle detection algorithm before INSP-007 start"
      - "Define S3 integration patterns before INSP-004 start"

  product:
    verdict: "READY"
    primary_issues:
      - "Stack-to-create gesture requires onboarding strategy (INSP-012)"
      - "Multi-parent albums may confuse users - UX validation needed"
    strengths:
      - "Clear phase prioritization"
      - "MOC linking differentiator is strong"
      - "User retention via collection building"

  qa:
    verdict: "CONCERNS"
    primary_issues:
      - "Missing test stories for DAG cycle detection"
      - "Touch device drag-and-drop testing scope large"
      - "Multi-file upload error scenarios complex"
    critical_test_gaps:
      - "Cycle detection edge cases (5+ parent levels)"
      - "Partial upload failures with S3 cleanup"
      - "Accessibility compliance (WCAG AA)"

  ux:
    verdict: "READY"
    primary_issues:
      - "Stack-to-create gesture is non-obvious - requires discovery UI"
      - "Multi-parent 'Also in' badge UX critical (INSP-013)"
    strengths:
      - "Core interaction patterns well-defined"
      - "Album hierarchy aligns with familiar metaphors"
      - "Accessibility path clear with INSP-019"

  platform:
    verdict: "READY"
    primary_issues:
      - "DAG queries may need optimization for deep hierarchies"
    strengths:
      - "Infrastructure exists (Aurora, S3, CloudFront)"
      - "Scaling plan for Phase 1-2 straightforward"
      - "Feature flags strategy supports rollout"

  security:
    verdict: "READY"
    primary_issues:
      - "S3 access control and presigned URL expiry critical"
      - "Album ownership verification required on every operation"
    strengths:
      - "Authorization strategy clear"
      - "Data protection approach comprehensive"
      - "Deletion safety mechanisms defined"

cross_cutting_concerns:
  dependencies:
    - "INSP-007 (album data model) unblocks INSP-009, 012, 013, 015"
    - "INSP-003 (API endpoints) unblocks INSP-004, 010"
    - "MOC Instructions epic must exist before INSP-014 starts"

  shared_risks:
    - "Multi-file upload with partial failure (INSP-008, INSP-020)"
    - "Drag-and-drop complexity (INSP-011, INSP-012, INSP-019)"
    - "Multi-parent album awareness (INSP-013, INSP-015, INSP-018)"

  recommended_additions:
    - "INSP-007-A: Database schema review and DAG algorithm specification"
    - "INSP-008-A: Multi-file upload error handling test suite"
    - "INSP-019-A: Accessibility baseline testing infrastructure"
    - "INSP-012-A: Stack gesture usability testing (5+ users)"

phase_readiness:
  phase_1: "READY - foundation stories (INSP-001, 003, 007) clear"
  phase_2: "READY - gallery and upload stories (INSP-002, 004, 008, 020) clear"
  phase_3: "READY - album management stories (INSP-005-013) clear"
  phase_4: "READY - integration stories (INSP-014-021) clear"

estimated_effort:
  phase_1: "3-4 weeks (DAG implementation is complex)"
  phase_2: "2-3 weeks (multi-file upload is complex)"
  phase_3: "3-4 weeks (drag-and-drop is complex)"
  phase_4: "4-5 weeks (accessibility is comprehensive)"
  total: "12-16 weeks"

approval_status:
  engineering: "APPROVE - subject to INSP-007 algorithm review"
  product: "APPROVE - proceed with Phase 1"
  qa: "APPROVE - with additional test stories"
  ux: "APPROVE - proceed with Phase 1"
  platform: "APPROVE - infrastructure ready"
  security: "APPROVE - with implementation checklist"

next_steps:
  immediate:

notes:
  - "All 6 perspectives converged on 'READY' verdict with implementation concerns"
  - "DAG cycle detection is the highest technical risk - prioritize design review"
  - "Multi-file upload error handling and accessibility testing are secondary risks"
  - "Stack-to-create gesture requires UX validation before Phase 3"
  - "Phase 1-2 can proceed with implementation while addressing technical risks"
