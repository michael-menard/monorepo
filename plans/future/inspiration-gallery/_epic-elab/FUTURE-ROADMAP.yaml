suggested_stories:
  - title: "Image optimization pipeline with thumbnail generation"
    source: engineering
    priority: P1
    reason: "Prevents future performance degradation but not required for MVP launch"

  - title: "Database query optimization for DAG traversal"
    source: engineering
    priority: P1
    reason: "Deep hierarchies may cause N+1 queries but MVP can launch with simpler queries"

  - title: "Drag-and-drop library spike and evaluation"
    source: engineering
    priority: P2
    reason: "Team unfamiliar with dnd-kit; evaluation helps Phase 3 planning"

  - title: "Album sharing and collaboration framework"
    source: product
    priority: P1
    reason: "Growth opportunity aligned with competitive platforms (Pinterest/Figma patterns)"

  - title: "Inspiration source tracking and attribution"
    source: product
    priority: P2
    reason: "Improves user retention but not required for MVP"

  - title: "Community gallery integration and discovery"
    source: product
    priority: P2
    reason: "Long-term differentiation opportunity beyond MOC linking"

  - title: "Accessibility compliance implementation (WCAG AA)"
    source: qa
    priority: P1
    reason: "Required by Phase 4 but extensive testing deferred to post-MVP"

  - title: "Performance testing suite for DAG operations"
    source: qa
    priority: P1
    reason: "Baseline established in MVP but comprehensive testing deferred"

stories_to_defer:
  - story: INSP-011
    reason: "Drag-and-drop reordering requires dnd-kit library evaluation. Defer to Phase 3 after team has evaluated options."

  - story: INSP-015
    reason: "Delete flows with multi-album options add complexity. MVP can use simple 'delete from all' approach, defer nuanced options to Phase 4."

  - story: INSP-016
    reason: "Metadata editing (tags, notes) is enhancement. Defer to Phase 4."

  - story: INSP-017
    reason: "Inspiration comments are social feature. Defer to Phase 5+."

  - story: INSP-020
    reason: "Loading states and animations are polish. Defer to Phase 4."

  - story: INSP-021
    reason: "Bulk operations (multi-select, batch actions) are advanced features. Defer to Phase 4-5."

phase_guidance:
  phase_1: "Focus on backend DAG schema and album CRUD. All platform and security infrastructure ready. No Phase 1 deferrals."
  phase_2: "Upload and gallery UI. Defer drag-and-drop library learning to Phase 3. Onboarding must be included. Image optimization is enhancement."
  phase_3: "Album management, drag-and-drop, multi-album awareness (breadcrumbs, badges, delete flows). Defer complex delete options to Phase 4."
  phase_4: "Polish, accessibility, bulk operations. Defer community features to Phase 5+"
  phase_5: "Album sharing, collaboration, community features, advanced search"

risk_mitigation:
  research_gap: "Multi-parent album mental model should be validated early (Phase 2) to avoid major rework"
  library_evaluation: "dnd-kit evaluation critical for Phase 3 timeline - recommend 2-3 day spike in Phase 2"
  performance: "DAG query performance monitoring essential from launch - implement metrics from day one"
