notes:
  phase_1_readiness: "Backend Phase 1 (INSP-003, INSP-007, INSP-009, INSP-010) blocked on DAG algorithm specification. Recommend 1-2 day spike before implementation."
  phase_2_readiness: "Frontend Phase 2 (INSP-001, INSP-002, INSP-004, INSP-005, INSP-008) blocked on upload error handling spec and onboarding story definition."
  MVP_definition: "Core journey = create album + add inspirations + link to MOC. All album parent operations and upload error handling must work correctly."
