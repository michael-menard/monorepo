timestamp: "2026-02-04T23:27:30Z"

design_completeness:
  defined: [card_component, upload_modal, drag_and_drop, delete_flows, breadcrumbs]
  needs_wireframes:
    - "Album creation modal (INSP-009)"
    - "Multi-parent 'Also in' badge placement (INSP-013)"
    - "Delete options dialog (INSP-015)"
    - "Metadata edit modal (INSP-016)"

interaction_patterns:
  core_patterns:
    - "Drag-and-drop reordering (established pattern)"
    - "Stack-to-create album (novel, requires discovery UI)"
    - "Session-based breadcrumbs (straightforward)"
    - "Multi-select bulk operations (advanced, Phase 4)"

  novel_interactions: [stack_to_create_album]
  requires_usability_testing: [stack_to_create_album]

usability_concerns:
  high:
    - "Stack-to-create gesture is non-obvious - requires tooltip and/or onboarding"
    - "Multi-parent albums may confuse users - 'Also in' badge UX critical"
    - "Delete with album options adds cognitive load - needs clear messaging"

  medium:
    - "Session-based breadcrumb doesn't match canonical path - may surprise users"
    - "Keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop is complex"
    - "Empty states for nested albums need different messaging"

accessibility_status:
  wcag_aa_readiness: "READY with INSP-019 implementation"
  high_priority_features:
    - "Keyboard equivalent for drag-and-drop (INSP-011)"
    - "Screen reader support for multi-parent badges (INSP-013)"
    - "Focus management in modals (INSP-015, 016)"

  requirements:
    - "All drag-and-drop must have keyboard alternative"
    - "Multi-select must support shift-click and checkboxes"
    - "Modals must trap focus and announce changes"

information_architecture:
  navigation_hierarchy: "VALID - clear page structure"
  mental_model_fit: "GOOD - albums align with file system metaphor"
  information_scent: "NEEDS WORK - stack gesture requires prominent discovery UI"

design_recommendations:
  insp_001: "Include nav pattern showing album access"
  insp_008: "Add progress indicator for multi-file uploads"
  insp_012: "Design prominent discovery UI for stack gesture (tooltip, animation)"
  insp_013: "Use badge or indicator to show all albums containing item"
  insp_015: "Structure delete modal with clear primary action"
  insp_018: "Create onboarding flow specifically for stack gesture"

content_strategy:
  empty_states:
    - "Main gallery: 'Start by uploading inspirations or creating albums'"
    - "Album: 'This album is empty. Add inspirations or drag them in.'"
    - "Search: 'No inspirations match your search. Try different keywords.'"

  microcopy_examples:
    - "Delete in multiple albums: 'This inspiration appears in N albums. Delete from all?'"
    - "Delete album: 'Deletes N inspirations. This action cannot be undone.'"
    - "Undo toast: 'Album created. Undo?'"

future:
  personalization: "User preferences for view (grid vs list)"
  customization: "Album cover image selection"

ux_notes:
  phase_1_focus: "Establish core gallery and album navigation"
  phase_2_focus: "Upload and multi-file interactions"
  phase_3_focus: "Album management and drag-and-drop"
  phase_4_focus: "Polish, accessibility, bulk operations"

  research_needed:
    - "Usability test stack-to-create gesture with 5+ users"
    - "Validate multi-parent mental model with target audience"
