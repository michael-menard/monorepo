      priority: "P0"
      phase: "2 Testing"

  stories_split:
    - original_id: "INSP-008"
      original_title: "Multi-file upload to album"
      decision: "accept"
      subtasks:
        - "INSP-008-A: Basic single-file upload modal with success path"
        - "INSP-008-B: Multi-file batch upload support"
        - "INSP-008-C: Error recovery and retry state machine"
      rationale: "Upload error handling is complex and cross-cutting. Breaking into separate stories allows parallel work on modal UI vs. error recovery logic."

    - original_id: "INSP-011"
      original_title: "Reorder inspirations in album (drag-and-drop)"
      decision: "accept"
      subtasks:
        - "INSP-011-A: Drag-and-drop library evaluation and recommendation"
        - "INSP-011-B: Keyboard reordering accessibility design and implementation"
      rationale: "Library choice impacts implementation approach. Keyboard accessibility must be designed in parallel with drag-and-drop."
