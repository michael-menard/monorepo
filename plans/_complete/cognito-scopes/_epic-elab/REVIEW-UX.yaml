upgrade_experience:
  - point: Tier badges visible throughout UI (COGN-017)
    impact: Reminds users of their tier without being intrusive

  - point: Quota usage indicators next to feature icons (COGN-017)
    example: "Wishlists 1/20" with progress bar
    impact: Shows room for growth; motivates power users

  - point: Upgrade CTAs in error messages, not success states (COGN-018)
    rationale: Non-intrusive; appears only when needed
    impact: Reduces annoyance; increases conversion

  - point: No paywalls blocking core MOC experience
    rationale: Free tier gets MOC build/share; quotas are generous
    impact: Aligns with platform mission

accessibility_requirements:
  - story: COGN-016
    requirement: Feature gating must use ARIA labels, not just visual treatment
    example: aria-disabled, aria-describedby with reason

  - story: COGN-018
    requirement: Error messages must be announced to screen readers
    example: role=alert for quota exceeded

  - story: COGN-021
    requirement: Age restriction message must be announced
    example: Clear, non-visual message

future:
  value_improvements:
    - story: COGN-016
      suggestion: Tier comparison modal showing features side-by-side
      impact: high
      reason: helps users understand upgrade path

    - story: COGN-017
      suggestion: Storage usage visualization (pie chart)
      impact: medium
      reason: helps power users manage large libraries

  suggested_stories:
    - title: Tier upgrade guided tour
      priority: P1
      reason: onboard users to pro features after upgrade

    - title: Trial period messaging
      priority: P2
      reason: Post-MVP; encourages trial signups

  recommendations:
    - "All tier restrictions must be explained in UI, not hidden"
    - "Error messages must motivate upgrade, not punish"
    - "Quota indicators must be visible and understandable"
    - "Age restrictions must be clear and fair"
    - "Test all journeys with real users before launch"
