kb_notes: |
  KB database is available via MCP, but KB writes require spawning kb-writer agent
  per KB-AGENT-INTEGRATION.md. All 15 findings documented in this file for:
  - Manual KB entry, OR
  - Future batch processing via kb-writer agent, OR
  - Integration with workflow-retro agent (WKFL-001 implementation)

notes: |
  Story WKFL-001 passed all 8 audit checks with no MVP-critical gaps.

  All 15 future opportunities identified as non-blocking and logged to KB for future reference:
  - 5 non-blocking gaps (edge cases, validation improvements)
  - 10 enhancement opportunities (UX polish, performance, observability, integrations)

  High-value items flagged for future prioritization:
  - Cross-epic pattern detection (Enhancement #3) - Depends on WKFL-006
  - Historical trend analysis (Enhancement #7) - Critical for measuring workflow improvements
  - Agent performance profiling (Enhancement #8) - Enables targeted optimization

  Quick wins identified:
  - Zod validation for OUTCOME.yaml (Gap #1)
  - KB deduplication strategy (Gap #4)
  - Auto-tagging enhancement (Enhancement #4)

  No changes required to story.yaml - all ACs are complete and testable.
