summary: |
  WKFL-005 (Doc Sync Agent) implementation is complete and well-documented.
  The agent (.claude/agents/doc-sync.agent.md) and command (.claude/commands/doc-sync.md)
  form a cohesive documentation automation tool. All acceptance criteria are covered
  with clear algorithms, error handling, and pre-commit hook integration.

  Ready for production use.
