# WKFL-005 Autonomous Decisions Log

decisions:
  - id: DEC-001
    timestamp: 2026-02-07T12:00:00-07:00
    category: story_readiness
    decision: "Proceed to implementation without story modifications"
    rationale: |
      After comprehensive 8-point audit, zero MVP-critical gaps were identified.
      All 6 acceptance criteria are complete, testable, and have verification steps.
      Architecture is fully specified with algorithms, error handling, and integration points.
      Story is remarkably well-formed and ready for implementation as-written.
    confidence: high
    impact: positive
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Add formal SYNC-REPORT schema to story"
      - "Specify change detection method in ACs"
      - "Add Mermaid validation tool requirement"
    why_this_decision: |
      All alternatives are implementation details that don't affect AC outcomes.
      Adding them would be premature specification that constrains developer flexibility.
      The story provides sufficient guidance without over-constraining implementation choices.

  - id: DEC-002
    timestamp: 2026-02-07T12:00:00-07:00
    category: gap_handling
    decision: "Document 6 non-blocking findings as future opportunities only"
    rationale: |
      All findings are quality enhancements or implementation details:
      1. Formal SYNC-REPORT schema (quality enhancement)
      2. Change detection method (implementation detail)
      3. Mermaid validation tool choice (implementation detail)
      4. Hook documentation location (documentation detail)
      5. Section mapping format (architecture detail)
      6. Concurrent run protection (edge case handling)

      None block the core user journey or AC completion.
    confidence: high
    impact: neutral
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Add findings as new ACs to story"
      - "Request PM to clarify implementation details"
    why_this_decision: |
      Adding as ACs would bloat the story with unnecessary implementation constraints.
      The findings are suggestions for the implementer, not requirements.
      Documenting as future opportunities preserves them without blocking MVP.

  - id: DEC-003
    timestamp: 2026-02-07T12:00:00-07:00
    category: kb_write
    decision: "Defer KB writes - no actionable lessons for general reuse"
    rationale: |
      The elaboration analysis validated story completeness but didn't uncover
      patterns or lessons that would benefit other stories. Findings are specific
      to this documentation automation story (schema formats, validation choices).

      KB writes are most valuable for:
      - Cross-story patterns (not applicable here)
      - Repeated failure modes (none identified)
      - Architecture decisions with precedent value (story is self-contained)

      If implementation reveals reusable patterns (e.g., "YAML frontmatter parsing
      best practices"), those should be written to KB during/after implementation.
    confidence: medium
    impact: neutral
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Write finding about 'well-formed story characteristics'"
      - "Write lesson about 'when implementation details belong in ACs vs not'"
    why_this_decision: |
      These meta-lessons are already captured in the workflow documentation and
      elaboration guidelines. Adding redundant KB entries creates noise without
      additional value. Wait for implementation learnings that are truly novel.

  - id: DEC-004
    timestamp: 2026-02-07T12:00:00-07:00
    category: analysis_approach
    decision: "Use comprehensive 8-point audit instead of checklist validation"
    rationale: |
      Story is foundational (P0) and touches critical workflow documentation.
      A thorough audit provides high confidence in story readiness and identifies
      subtle issues that a checklist might miss.

      The 8-point audit systematically evaluates:
      1. Scope alignment
      2. Internal consistency
      3. Reuse-first
      4. Ports & adapters
      5. Local testability
      6. Decision completeness
      7. Risk disclosure
      8. Story sizing

      Given the story's quality, the audit confirmed readiness rather than
      identifying gaps (which is itself a valuable validation).
    confidence: high
    impact: positive
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Quick checklist validation (faster but less thorough)"
      - "Focus only on ACs and test plan"
    why_this_decision: |
      Foundation stories warrant extra scrutiny to prevent downstream issues.
      The comprehensive audit builds confidence and documents due diligence.
      Time investment (analysis phase) is justified by story priority and scope.

  - id: DEC-005
    timestamp: 2026-02-07T12:00:00-07:00
    category: elaboration_verdict
    decision: "Mark story as PASS (unconditional)"
    rationale: |
      All audit checks PASS:
      - Scope alignment: PASS
      - Internal consistency: PASS
      - Reuse-first: PASS
      - Ports & adapters: PASS (with minor observation)
      - Local testability: PASS
      - Decision completeness: PASS
      - Risk disclosure: PASS
      - Story sizing: PASS

      Zero MVP-critical gaps identified.
      Six non-blocking findings documented as future opportunities.
      Story is ready for immediate implementation.
    confidence: high
    impact: positive
    alternatives_considered:
      - "CONDITIONAL PASS (pending clarifications)"
      - "PASS with recommended AC additions"
    why_this_decision: |
      No conditions or blockers exist that would justify a conditional pass.
      Adding recommended ACs would be scope creep (findings are non-critical).
      Unconditional PASS accurately reflects story readiness state.

  - id: DEC-006
    timestamp: 2026-02-07T12:00:00-07:00
    category: documentation
    decision: "Provide detailed future opportunities document (8 opportunities)"
    rationale: |
      While none of the opportunities are MVP-critical, they represent valuable
      enhancements that may be useful during implementation or in future iterations.
      Documenting them preserves the analysis investment and gives the implementer
      options to consider if time/budget allows.

      The opportunities are prioritized (low/medium) and include effort estimates
      to help with planning. Each opportunity includes rationale for why it's
      non-blocking (preventing misinterpretation as requirements).
    confidence: high
    impact: positive
    alternatives_considered:
      - "Brief bullet list of opportunities"
      - "No opportunities document (findings weren't critical)"
    why_this_decision: |
      Detailed documentation provides maximum value to implementer and future
      maintainers. The opportunities are well-reasoned and actionable, even if
      optional. Writing costs are marginal (already analyzed) and documentation
      is reusable across team.

summary:
  total_decisions: 6
  mvp_critical_gaps: 0
  non_blocking_findings: 6
  story_modifications: 0
  kb_writes: 0
  elaboration_outcome: "PASS - Ready for implementation"
  confidence_level: "High"
  recommended_next_step: "Move to ready-to-work and assign to developer"

notes: |
  This elaboration was straightforward due to exceptional story quality.
  The PM who generated this story provided comprehensive specification with:
  - Complete ACs with verification steps
  - Detailed architecture notes and algorithms
  - Comprehensive test plan
  - Reality baseline documenting existing structure
  - Clear reuse plan and integration points

  Future stories should reference WKFL-005 as an example of well-formed stories
  that minimize elaboration overhead and maximize implementation velocity.
