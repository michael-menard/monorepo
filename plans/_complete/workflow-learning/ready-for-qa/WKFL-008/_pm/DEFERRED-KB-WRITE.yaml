notes: |
  WKFL-008 is a pure workflow framework story that:
  - Creates experiment configuration (experiments.yaml)
  - Adds traffic routing to PM pipeline
  - Extends story.yaml and OUTCOME.yaml schemas
  - Creates experiment-analyzer agent for statistical analysis
  - Generates /experiment-report command

  No traditional backend/frontend/database touches, only workflow agent modifications.

  When KB becomes available, insert this story record to enable searchability
  in future /story-search and pattern mining operations.
