  # Prediction rationale
  rationale:
    split_risk_factors:
      - "5 ACs above threshold (3+) adds 0.2 base risk"
      - "Statistical analysis complexity adds 0.1"
      - "Multi-agent integration (pm-story-generation-leader, dev-documentation-leader, experiment-analyzer) adds 0.2"
      - "Schema evolution (story.yaml, OUTCOME.yaml extensions) adds 0.1"
      - "Total: 0.6 split risk (medium-high)"

    review_cycles_factors:
      - "Base: 1 cycle for straightforward implementation"
      - "Statistical correctness verification: +1 cycle (t-test validation)"
      - "Multi-file integration testing: +1 cycle (traffic routing, variant propagation)"
      - "Total: 3 cycles expected"

    token_estimate_factors:
      - "Dev feasibility review estimates 95k tokens (85k core + 10k risk mitigation)"
      - "No similar completed stories with OUTCOME.yaml available yet"
      - "Using dev feasibility estimate as primary source"
      - "Similar story pattern: statistical analysis frameworks (WKFL-002, WKFL-006) suggest 45-85k range"
      - "95k estimate is on high end but justified by multi-agent integration complexity"

    confidence_rationale:
      - "Medium confidence due to:"
      - "✓ 3 similar stories identified (WKFL-001, WKFL-002, WKFL-006)"
      - "✗ No completed OUTCOME.yaml data for similar stories yet"
      - "✗ WKFL-006 patterns not available (story in-progress)"
      - "✓ Dev feasibility review provides detailed effort estimate"
      - "Overall: Medium confidence with heavier weight on dev feasibility estimate"
