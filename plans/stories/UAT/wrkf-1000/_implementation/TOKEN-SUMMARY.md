| 3B: Playwright | Playwright | — | — | N/A |

## High-Cost Operations

Operations that consumed >10k tokens:

| Operation | Tokens | Reason | Avoidable? |
|-----------|--------|--------|------------|
| Planner: Read LESSONS-LEARNED.md | ~4,575 | 18.3KB file with all past stories | Yes - use recent entries only |
| Planner: Read wrkf-1000.md | ~2,468 | Full story context | No - required |
| Backend Coder: Read templates | ~3,500 | Multiple package.json/tsconfig refs | No - needed for accuracy |

No single operation exceeded 10k tokens. Total planner phase was ~16k due to cumulative reads.

## Optimization Notes

1. **LESSONS-LEARNED.md growing large** - At 18KB+, this file adds ~4.5k tokens to every planner run. Consider:
   - Creating LESSONS-LEARNED-RECENT.md with only last 3-5 stories
   - Or extracting common patterns to a separate reference doc

2. **Story file read by all agents** - wrkf-1000.md (~9.8KB) was read by 4 sub-agents. Consider passing extracted context instead of full file.

3. **This was a lightweight story** - ~51k tokens for pure package scaffolding with 10 ACs and 5 files is a good baseline for minimal stories.

4. **No frontend/contracts phases** - Saved significant tokens by skipping inapplicable phases.
