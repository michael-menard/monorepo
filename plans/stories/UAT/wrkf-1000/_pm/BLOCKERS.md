# Blockers: wrkf-1000 — Package Scaffolding

## Status: NO BLOCKERS

All preconditions are satisfied:
- ✅ Existing package patterns available in codebase
- ✅ pnpm workspace configuration is clear
- ✅ LangGraphJS available on npm
- ✅ Turborepo integration automatic
- ✅ No UI components touched

---

## Resolved Decisions

### Decision 1: Package Location

**Question:** Where should the orchestrator package live?

**Decision:** `packages/orchestrator/`

**Rationale:** Follows the meta plan (`wrkf.plan.meta.md`) which explicitly specifies:
- `packages/orchestrator` — LangGraph runtime, nodes, state
- `packages/orchestrator/adapters` — OpenCode, MCP adapters (future stories)
- `packages/orchestrator/graphs` — Subgraph definitions (future stories)

---

### Decision 2: Package Name

**Question:** What npm package name to use?

**Decision:** `@repo/orchestrator`

**Rationale:** Follows existing monorepo convention (e.g., `@repo/logger`, `@repo/lambda-utils`).

---

### Decision 3: Initial Exports

**Question:** What should the package export initially?

**Decision:** Minimal placeholder exports only:
- Package version constant
- Empty placeholder for GraphState (actual implementation in wrkf-1010)

**Rationale:** This story focuses on scaffolding, not implementation. Future stories add actual functionality.

---

### Decision 4: LangGraphJS Version

**Question:** Which version of LangGraphJS to use?

**Decision:** `@langchain/langgraph@^1.1.0` with `@langchain/core@^0.3.0`

**Rationale:** Latest stable versions as of story creation. Caret allows minor updates.
