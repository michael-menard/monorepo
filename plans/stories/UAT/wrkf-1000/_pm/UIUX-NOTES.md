# UI/UX Notes: wrkf-1000 — Package Scaffolding

## Verdict: SKIPPED

### Justification

This story creates `packages/orchestrator`, a pure TypeScript backend/infrastructure package for LangGraph orchestration. It contains:

- TypeScript source code
- Zod schemas for state validation
- LangGraphJS runtime integration

**No UI components, pages, routes, or frontend code are touched.**

The UI/UX agent review is not applicable for this story.
