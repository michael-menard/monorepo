# UIUX-NOTES: wrkf-1010

## Verdict: SKIPPED

## Justification

This story does not touch UI because:
- It defines Zod schemas for LangGraph orchestrator state management
- All code lives in `packages/orchestrator/src/state/` (backend package)
- It is a pure TypeScript/Zod schema definition story
- No React components are created or modified
- No frontend routes are affected
- No visual elements, styling, or user-facing interactions are involved

## UI/UX Review Not Required

No UI components, routes, or visual elements are affected by this story.
