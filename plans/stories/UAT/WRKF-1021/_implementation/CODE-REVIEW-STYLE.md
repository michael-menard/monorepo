## Notes

This story (WRKF-1021: Node Execution Metrics) is a **backend-only implementation**. All touched files are:

1. Pure TypeScript files in `packages/backend/orchestrator/`
2. Contain only Zod schemas, class definitions, type exports, and Vitest tests
3. Have no JSX, no UI components, no `className` attributes
4. Have no styling concerns whatsoever

The style compliance check is **not applicable (N/A)** for this story as there are zero frontend files, zero UI components, and zero styling-related code.
