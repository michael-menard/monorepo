# Blockers: wrkf-1020 — Node Runner Infrastructure

**Status:** NO HARD BLOCKERS

## Soft Dependencies (Resolved via Story Order)

1. **wrkf-1010: GraphState Schema**
   - Status: `generated`
   - Required exports: `GraphStateSchema`, `NodeErrorSchema`, `RoutingFlagSchema`
   - Resolution: Story is correctly sequenced — wrkf-1020 depends on wrkf-1010

2. **@repo/logger dependency**
   - The orchestrator package does not currently have `@repo/logger` as a dependency
   - Resolution: AC will include adding the dependency

## PM Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use pure Zod schemas (not LangGraph Annotation) | LangGraph v0.2.x supports generic typed state; aligns with wrkf-1010 decision |
| Return partial state updates from nodes | Matches LangGraph's expected node signature |
| Adapt retry patterns from @repo/api-client | Reuse existing proven patterns rather than duplicating |
| Use createLogger() pattern from @repo/logger | Matches codebase convention |

## No Blocking TBDs

All design decisions have been made and documented in this story.
