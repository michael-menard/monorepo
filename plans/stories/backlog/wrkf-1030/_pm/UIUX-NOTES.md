# UIUX-NOTES: wrkf-1030

## Status: SKIPPED

**Justification:** This story implements the `bootstrap_graph` subgraph for the LangGraph orchestrator. It is a pure TypeScript backend infrastructure story with no UI components, no frontend routes, and no visual elements.

The story scope includes:
- Plan analyzer node
- Story splitter node
- Index generator node
- Meta/exec plan generator node

All of these are backend processing nodes that operate on markdown files and produce structured artifacts. There is no user interface involved.
