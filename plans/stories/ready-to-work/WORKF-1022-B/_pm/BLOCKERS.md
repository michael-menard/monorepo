## Dependency Blockers

### wrkf-1022-A: Core Middleware Infrastructure

| Item | Status | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Story ID | wrkf-1022-A | **BLOCKING IMPLEMENTATION** |
| Current Status | `generated` (not implemented) | Must be `completed` before wrkf-1022-B |
| Required Exports | `NodeMiddleware`, `composeMiddleware()`, `MiddlewareContext` | Core types and utilities |

**Resolution:** wrkf-1022-A must be implemented first. This is documented in the story's `Depends On` field.
