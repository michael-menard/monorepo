## Decisions

### [2024-07-12] Adopt Monorepo Structure
- **Context:**
  - Multiple apps and shared code required a scalable structure.
- **Decision:**
  - Use a monorepo to manage all apps and packages together.
- **Alternatives Considered:**
  - Separate repos for each app/package (harder to share code, more overhead).
- **Consequences:**
  - Easier code sharing, unified tooling, but requires careful dependency management.
