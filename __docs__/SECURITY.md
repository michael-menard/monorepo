# Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the monorepo to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers to protect against various attacks:

### Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **default-src 'self'**: Only allows resources from the same origin
- **script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'**: Allows scripts from same origin and inline scripts (needed for development)
- **style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'**: Allows styles from same origin and inline styles
- **img-src 'self' data: https:** Allows images from same origin, data URIs, and HTTPS sources
- **font-src 'self'**: Only allows fonts from same origin
- **connect-src 'self' http://localhost:* https:** Allows connections to same origin, localhost (development), and HTTPS sources
- **object-src 'none'**: Blocks all plugins and objects
- **frame-src 'none'**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **worker-src 'self' blob:** Allows web workers from same origin and blob URLs
- **form-action 'self'**: Restricts form submissions to same origin

### XSS Protection
- **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block**: Enables browser's XSS filter
- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY**: Prevents clickjacking attacks

### Other Security Headers
- **Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()**: Restricts access to sensitive APIs

## Security Scanning

### Automated Security Checks
The project includes automated security scanning through:

1. **npm audit**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **ESLint Security Plugin**: Catches security issues in code
3. **GitHub Actions Security Workflow**: Runs security scans on every PR and push
4. **CodeQL Analysis**: GitHub's semantic code analysis for security vulnerabilities

### Security Scripts
- `pnpm run security:audit`: Run npm audit with moderate level
- `pnpm run security:fix`: Automatically fix security vulnerabilities
- `pnpm run security:check`: Run audit and linting
- `pnpm run security:scan`: Full security scan including header tests
- `pnpm run security:headers:test`: Test security headers are properly set

## Development Security

### ESLint Security Rules
The project uses `eslint-plugin-security` with strict rules:

- **Object injection detection**: Prevents prototype pollution
- **Unsafe regex detection**: Catches potentially dangerous regular expressions
- **Eval detection**: Prevents use of eval() and similar functions
- **Child process detection**: Monitors for potentially dangerous process spawning
- **XSS prevention**: Catches common XSS patterns

### TypeScript Security
- **Strict type checking**: Prevents type-related vulnerabilities
- **No explicit any**: Forces proper typing
- **Unsafe operation detection**: Catches unsafe TypeScript operations

## Production Security

### Build-time Security
- **Security headers injection**: Headers are added to HTML during build
- **Source map protection**: Source maps are only generated in development
- **Minification**: Code is minified to obfuscate implementation details

### Runtime Security
- **Helmet.js**: Backend applications use Helmet for security headers
- **Input sanitization**: All user inputs are sanitized
- **Rate limiting**: API endpoints are protected with rate limiting
- **CORS configuration**: Proper CORS settings for production domains

## Vulnerability Management

### Dependency Management
- **Regular audits**: Dependencies are audited weekly via GitHub Actions
- **Automatic updates**: Security patches are applied automatically when possible
- **Version pinning**: Exact versions are used to prevent supply chain attacks

### Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security@example.com with details
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Provide any relevant code or logs

## Security Best Practices

### Code Guidelines
1. **Never use eval()** or similar dynamic code execution
2. **Sanitize all user inputs** before processing
3. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
4. **Validate file uploads** for type and size
5. **Use HTTPS** for all production communications
6. **Implement proper authentication** and authorization
7. **Log security events** for monitoring

### Development Guidelines
1. **Run security scans** before committing code
2. **Keep dependencies updated** regularly
3. **Review security audit reports** from CI/CD
4. **Test security headers** in development
5. **Use security linting** in your IDE

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Monitoring
- **GitHub Security tab**: Monitors for vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **CodeQL alerts**: Automated security issue detection
- **Security workflow failures**: CI/CD alerts for security check failures

### Incident Response
1. **Immediate assessment** of security issues
2. **Temporary mitigation** if needed
3. **Root cause analysis** and permanent fix
4. **Security review** to prevent similar issues
5. **Documentation update** with lessons learned

## Compliance

This security implementation helps meet requirements for:
- **OWASP Top 10**: Addresses common web application vulnerabilities
- **GDPR**: Protects user data and privacy
- **SOC 2**: Security controls for service organizations
- **PCI DSS**: Payment card industry security standards (if applicable)

## Updates

This security documentation is updated regularly as new security measures are implemented or as threats evolve. Last updated: January 2025.
