# Auggie + Taskmaster AI Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide shows how to leverage both Auggie and Taskmaster AI together for maximum development productivity. Taskmaster AI provides project management and task breakdown, while Auggie provides autonomous implementation capabilities.

## Integration Strategy

### üéØ **Taskmaster AI Role**: Project Planning & Progress Tracking
- Break down complex projects into manageable tasks
- Track progress and dependencies
- Research and update tasks with new findings
- Manage project context and documentation

### ü§ñ **Auggie Role**: Implementation & Code Execution  
- Implement specific tasks autonomously
- Handle multi-file refactoring and complex coding
- Provide deep codebase understanding
- Execute terminal commands and automation

## Current Project Context

Based on your Taskmaster setup, you have:
- **15 tasks** for Backend Docker Modernization
- **7 completed tasks** ‚úÖ
- **1 in-progress task** (Task #12: Auth and LEGO API Native Execution tests)
- **7 pending tasks** 

## Practical Integration Workflows

### 1. **Daily Development Workflow**

#### Morning Startup:
```bash
# 1. Check what to work on next
task-master next

# 2. Get detailed task information
task-master show <task-id>

# 3. Start Auggie with task context
auggie "I need to work on Task #12: Update auth service and LEGO API unit, integration, and E2E tests for native execution. Here are the details: [paste task details]"
```

#### During Implementation:
```bash
# Use Auggie for implementation
auggie "Update the auth service tests to connect to localhost MongoDB instead of Docker"

# Log progress back to Taskmaster
task-master update-subtask --id=12.1 --prompt="Completed auth service test updates. Modified test configs to use localhost:27017 for MongoDB connection."
```

### 2. **Task-Specific Integration Patterns**

#### For Code Implementation Tasks:
```bash
# Get task details from Taskmaster
task-master show 5

# Use Auggie with full context
auggie "I need to implement enhanced development scripts with Turbo. The requirements are:
- Add dev:infra, dev:all, dev:auth commands to root package.json
- Implement health checks for all services
- Target startup time <30 seconds

Please analyze the current monorepo structure and implement these scripts."
```

#### For Research Tasks:
```bash
# Use Taskmaster's research capability first
task-master research "Best practices for Turbo monorepo development scripts with health checks" --save-to=5

# Then use Auggie for implementation
auggie --continue "Based on the research findings, implement the Turbo development scripts"
```

### 3. **Advanced Integration Examples**

#### Complex Task Breakdown:
```bash
# Expand a complex task in Taskmaster
task-master expand --id=11 --research --force

# For each subtask, use Auggie to implement
task-master show 11.1
auggie "Implement unit tests for infrastructure health checks based on these requirements: [paste details]"

# Update progress
task-master set-status --id=11.1 --status=done
```

#### Multi-service Updates:
```bash
# Get multiple related tasks
task-master show 2,3,4

# Use Auggie with comprehensive context
auggie "I need to update multiple services for native execution:
1. Auth service (Task #2) - completed
2. LEGO API (Task #3) - completed  
3. Frontend apps (Task #4) - completed

Now I need to update their tests (Task #12). Please analyze the current test configurations and update them for native execution."
```

## Specific Integration for Your Current Tasks

### Task #12 (In Progress): Test Updates
```bash
# Get current status
task-master show 12

# Use Auggie for implementation
auggie "I need to update auth service and LEGO API tests for native execution. 

Auth Service Tests:
- Update to connect to localhost:27017 MongoDB
- Ensure integration tests work with native execution
- Update test configurations

LEGO API Tests:  
- Update to connect to localhost:5432 PostgreSQL
- Update to connect to localhost:6379 Redis
- Update to connect to localhost:9200 Elasticsearch
- Update unit, integration, and E2E tests

Please analyze current test files and make necessary updates."

# Log findings back to Taskmaster
task-master update-subtask --id=12 --prompt="Auggie analysis complete. Found test configuration files need updates for native database connections. Starting implementation phase."
```

### Task #5 (Pending): Enhanced Development Scripts
```bash
# Research first
task-master research "Turbo monorepo development scripts with health checks and dependency management" --save-to=5

# Then implement with Auggie
auggie "Create enhanced development scripts using Turbo for our monorepo. Requirements:
- dev:infra: docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
- dev:all: pnpm dev:infra && turbo dev --parallel  
- dev:auth, dev:lego, dev:frontend commands
- Health check scripts for all services
- Target <30 second startup time

Analyze current package.json and implement these scripts."
```

## Integration Best Practices

### 1. **Context Sharing**
```bash
# Always provide Auggie with Taskmaster context
auggie "Working on Taskmaster Task #X: [title]. Requirements: [details]. Test strategy: [testStrategy]"
```

### 2. **Progress Tracking**
```bash
# Regular progress updates to Taskmaster
task-master update-subtask --id=X --prompt="Progress update: [what was accomplished]"

# Status changes
task-master set-status --id=X --status=in-progress
task-master set-status --id=X --status=done
```

### 3. **Knowledge Preservation**
```bash
# Use Taskmaster research to inform future work  
task-master research "Implementation approach for [topic]" --save-to=X

# Log Auggie's findings back to Taskmaster
task-master update-task --id=X --append --prompt="Auggie implementation findings: [key learnings]"
```

## Automation Scripts

### Daily Workflow Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# daily-dev.sh

echo "üéØ Getting next task from Taskmaster..."
NEXT_TASK=$(task-master next)
echo "$NEXT_TASK"

echo "ü§ñ Starting Auggie with task context..."
read -p "Press enter to start Auggie with this task context..."
auggie "I'm working on the next task from Taskmaster: $NEXT_TASK"
```

### Task Completion Script  
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# complete-task.sh

if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <task-id>"
    exit 1
fi

TASK_ID=$1

echo "üìù Updating task status to done..."
task-master set-status --id=$TASK_ID --status=done

echo "üéØ Getting next task..."
task-master next
```

## Automation Script

A complete integration script has been created at `scripts/auggie-taskmaster-integration.sh` to automate the workflow:

```bash
# Basic usage - get next task from Taskmaster
./scripts/auggie-taskmaster-integration.sh

# Work on specific task
./scripts/auggie-taskmaster-integration.sh 12

# The script will:
# 1. Check dependencies (task-master and auggie)
# 2. Get task details from Taskmaster  
# 3. Launch Auggie with full task context
# 4. Offer to update task progress after completion
```

## Environment Setup

### Add to your shell profile (.zshrc/.bashrc):
```bash
# Taskmaster + Auggie Integration
alias tm="task-master"
alias aug="auggie"

# Quick workflows
alias tm-next="task-master next"
alias tm-show="task-master show"
alias aug-task="auggie --continue"

# Automated integration workflow
alias tm-aug="./scripts/auggie-taskmaster-integration.sh"

# Combined workflow function (manual version)
tm-aug-manual() {
    if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
        echo "Usage: tm-aug-manual <task-id>"
        return 1
    fi
    
    echo "üìã Getting task details..."
    TASK_DETAILS=$(task-master show $1)
    echo "$TASK_DETAILS"
    
    echo "ü§ñ Starting Auggie with task context..."
    auggie "Working on Taskmaster Task #$1: $TASK_DETAILS"
}
```

## Quick Start

### 1. **Use the Automated Script** (Recommended):
```bash
# Work on your current in-progress task
./scripts/auggie-taskmaster-integration.sh 12

# Or let it show you the next task
./scripts/auggie-taskmaster-integration.sh
```

### 2. **Manual Integration**:
```bash
# Get task details
task-master show 12

# Start Auggie with context
auggie "I'm working on Task #12: Update Tests - Auth and LEGO API Native Execution..."
```

### 3. **After Implementation**:
```bash
# Update progress
task-master update-task --id=12 --append --prompt="Completed auth service test updates"

# Mark as done when finished
task-master set-status --id=12 --status=done

# Get next task
task-master next
```

## Workflow Optimization

1. **Establish the Workflow**:
   - Use Taskmaster for planning and tracking
   - Use Auggie for implementation  
   - Regular progress updates between tools

2. **Create Custom Patterns**:
   - Build task templates in Taskmaster
   - Use Auggie's session continuation for complex tasks
   - Develop project-specific automation scripts

3. **Advanced Usage**:
   - Combine with your existing development scripts
   - Integrate into CI/CD pipelines using auggie `--print` mode
   - Use Taskmaster research features to inform Auggie sessions

## Benefits of This Integration

- ‚úÖ **Strategic Planning** (Taskmaster) + **Tactical Execution** (Auggie)
- ‚úÖ **Progress Tracking** with detailed implementation logs
- ‚úÖ **Knowledge Preservation** across both tools
- ‚úÖ **Context-Aware Development** with full project understanding
- ‚úÖ **Efficient Task Completion** with autonomous implementation
