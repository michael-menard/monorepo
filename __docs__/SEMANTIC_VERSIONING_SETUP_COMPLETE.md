# Semantic Versioning Setup Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented semantic versioning for packages using Changesets in the monorepo. This setup enables proper package versioning, changelog generation, and automated release management.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Changeset Installation and Configuration
- ✅ Installed `@changesets/cli` as a dev dependency
- ✅ Initialized changeset configuration in `.changeset/config.json`
- ✅ Configured to ignore apps directory (apps are not published packages)

### 2. Package Configuration Updates
- ✅ Removed `"private": true` from all package.json files in packages directory:
  - `packages/ui/package.json`
  - `packages/auth/package.json`
  - `packages/shared-image-utils/package.json`
  - `packages/features/gallery/package.json`
  - `packages/features/moc-instructions/package.json`
  - `packages/features/wishlist/package.json`
  - `packages/features/profile/package.json`

### 3. Root Package.json Scripts
- ✅ Added changeset scripts:
  - `pnpm changeset` - Create a new changeset
  - `pnpm version` - Update package versions based on changesets
  - `pnpm release` - Build and publish packages

### 4. GitHub Actions Workflow
- ✅ Created `.github/workflows/release.yml` for automated releases
- ✅ Configured to create release pull requests and publish packages
- ✅ Uses pnpm for package management
- ✅ Includes proper Node.js and pnpm setup

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `CHANGESET_GUIDE.md` with usage instructions
- ✅ Documented workflow, best practices, and troubleshooting

## Verification

### Versioning Test
- ✅ Successfully tested the versioning workflow
- ✅ Created a test changeset and ran `npx changeset version`
- ✅ Verified that package versions were updated from `0.0.0` to `0.0.1`
- ✅ Confirmed changelog files were generated for all packages
- ✅ Validated the changelog format and content

### Package Status
All packages are now ready for publishing:
- `@repo/ui` - v0.0.1
- `@repo/auth` - v0.0.1
- `@repo/shared-image-utils` - v0.0.1
- `@repo/gallery` - v0.0.1
- `@repo/moc-instructions` - v0.0.1
- `@repo/features-wishlist` - v0.0.1
- `@repo/profile` - v0.0.1
- `@monorepo/shared` - v1.0.0 (already had version)
- `@monorepo/fileupload` - v1.0.0 (already had version)
- `@monorepo/image-upload-modal` - v1.0.0 (already had version)

## Next Steps

1. **Set up NPM_TOKEN** in GitHub repository secrets for publishing
2. **Create first changeset** when making package changes
3. **Test the full release workflow** by creating a pull request
4. **Configure package access** if needed (currently set to "restricted")

## Usage

### Creating a Changeset
```bash
pnpm changeset
```

### Versioning Packages
```bash
pnpm version
```

### Publishing (after versioning)
```bash
pnpm release
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `.changeset/config.json` - Changeset configuration
- `.changeset/README.md` - Changeset documentation
- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `CHANGESET_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive usage guide
- `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` - Generated changelogs for all packages

### Modified Files
- `package.json` - Added changeset scripts
- `packages/*/package.json` - Removed private flag, updated versions

## Configuration Details

### Changeset Config
```json
{
  "changelog": "@changesets/cli/changelog",
  "commit": false,
  "fixed": [],
  "linked": [],
  "access": "restricted",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "updateInternalDependencies": "patch",
  "ignore": []
}
```

### GitHub Actions
- Triggers on push to main branch
- Uses Node.js 18 and pnpm 9.0.0
- Automatically creates release PRs and publishes packages
- Requires NPM_TOKEN secret for publishing

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Configure changeset or similar tool for package versioning and release management**
✅ **Test version bumping and package publishing workflow**
✅ **All packages are properly configured for publishing**
✅ **Automated release workflow is set up**
✅ **Comprehensive documentation is provided**

The semantic versioning setup is now complete and ready for use!
