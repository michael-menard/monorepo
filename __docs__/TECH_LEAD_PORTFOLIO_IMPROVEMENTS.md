## Details & Actionable Suggestions

### 1. CI/CD
- Add a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (or similar for your CI tool) to run tests, lint, and (optionally) build/deploy.
- Document the pipeline in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- Even a “mock” pipeline with comments is valuable for portfolio purposes.

### 2. Code Review/PR Template
- Add `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` with a checklist (tests, docs, rationale, etc.).
- Shows you care about code quality and team process.

### 3. Issue Templates
- Add `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` and `feature_request.md`.
- Demonstrates process for bug/feature tracking.

### 4. Advanced Testing
- Add an example of an integration or e2e test (e.g., API + DB, or frontend e2e with Playwright/Cypress).
- Document test coverage and reporting (even if partial).

### 5. Retrospective/Postmortem
- Add a `RETROSPECTIVE.md` or `POSTMORTEM.md` with a sample incident and lessons learned.
- Shows leadership in learning from mistakes and improving.

### 6. Security Review or Threat Model
- Add a `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` or expand `SECURITY.md` with a threat model diagram, list of mitigations, and a sample security checklist.
- Security is a tech lead’s responsibility.

### 7. Performance/Scalability Plan
- Add a `PERFORMANCE.md` with notes on load testing, scaling strategies, and known bottlenecks.
- Tech leads think about growth and bottlenecks.

### 8. Stakeholder/Team Communication Example
- Add a `STAKEHOLDER_UPDATE.md` or sample “project update” email/report.
- Tech leads bridge technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 9. Roadmap or Backlog Example
- Add a `ROADMAP.md` or `BACKLOG.md` with sample features, priorities, and timelines.
- Shows you can plan and prioritize.

### 10. Diversity & Inclusion Statement
- Add a `DIVERSITY_INCLUSION.md` with your philosophy and any concrete actions.
- Modern tech leads are expected to foster inclusive teams.
