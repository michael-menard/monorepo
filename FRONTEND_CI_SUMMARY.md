# Turborepo-Integrated CI/CD Protection

## 🎯 What's Now Protected

Your monorepo now has **intelligent CI/CD protection** with Turborepo change detection that only runs checks and deployments for changed projects:

### ✅ Automated Checks on Every PR

**GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/lego-moc-instructions-app.yml`

**Required Status Checks**:
- **Unit Tests** - All Vitest tests must pass
- **Lint & Type Check** - ESLint and TypeScript validation  
- **Build App** - Code must compile successfully
- **E2E Tests** - Playwright end-to-end tests
- **Security Audit** - Dependency vulnerability scanning

### ✅ Pre-commit Protection (Local)

**Husky Hook**: `.husky/pre-commit`

**Local Checks Before Commit**:
- **Prettier Formatting** - Auto-formats code if needed
- **Build Verification** - Ensures TypeScript compiles
- **Lint-staged** - Runs targeted checks on changed files

### ✅ Branch Protection Rules

**Configuration**: `.github/branch-protection.yml` + `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh`

**Protection Features**:
- Pull requests required for merges
- At least 1 approving review required
- All status checks must pass
- Linear history enforced (no merge commits)
- Force pushes disabled

## 🚀 Setup Status

### ✅ Already Configured
- Enhanced GitHub Actions workflows
- Husky pre-commit hooks installed
- Lint-staged configuration updated
- Test scripts available

### 🔧 Manual Setup Required

**1. Branch Protection Rules** (One-time setup):
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if needed
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Run automated setup
./scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh
```

**2. Test the Setup**:
```bash
# Test pre-commit hooks
./scripts/test-pre-commit.sh

# Test environment configuration
./scripts/test-env-config.sh staging
```

## 📋 How It Works

### Pull Request Workflow
1. **Developer creates PR** → GitHub Actions triggered
2. **All status checks run** → Unit tests, linting, build, E2E tests
3. **Checks must pass** → Merge button disabled until green
4. **Review required** → At least 1 approval needed
5. **Merge allowed** → Only after all requirements met

### Local Development Workflow
1. **Developer makes changes** → Edits frontend code
2. **Stages changes** → `git add .`
3. **Attempts commit** → `git commit -m "message"`
4. **Pre-commit hooks run** → Formatting, build check
5. **Commit succeeds** → Only if hooks pass

## 🛠️ Current Configuration

### Relaxed Pre-commit (Pragmatic Approach)
The pre-commit hooks are currently **lenient** to work with existing code:
- ✅ **Prettier formatting** (auto-fixes)
- ✅ **Build verification** (catches compilation errors)
- ⚠️ **ESLint warnings** (informational only)

### Strict CI Checks (Quality Gate)
The GitHub Actions are **comprehensive** for new PRs:
- ✅ **All tests must pass**
- ✅ **No build errors**
- ✅ **Security scans**
- ✅ **Performance audits**

## 🔍 Testing Your Setup

### Test Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Make a test change
echo "// Test change" >> apps/web/lego-moc-instructions-app/src/main.tsx

# Stage and commit (hooks will run)
git add .
git commit -m "test: trigger pre-commit hooks"

# Clean up if successful
git reset HEAD~1
git checkout -- apps/web/lego-moc-instructions-app/src/main.tsx
```

### Test CI Pipeline
1. Create a feature branch
2. Make a small change to frontend code
3. Push and create a PR
4. Verify all status checks run and pass
5. Confirm merge is blocked until checks pass

## 📊 Benefits Achieved

### ✅ Code Quality
- Consistent formatting with Prettier
- TypeScript compilation verified
- Unit test coverage maintained
- Security vulnerabilities caught

### ✅ Team Productivity  
- Issues caught early (pre-commit)
- Automated quality gates
- No broken code in main branch
- Consistent development workflow

### ✅ Deployment Safety
- Only tested code reaches production
- Build failures caught before merge
- Automated security scanning
- Performance monitoring

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Make Pre-commit Stricter
Edit `.husky/pre-commit` to add:
```bash
# Add ESLint checking
if ! pnpm lint; then
    echo "❌ ESLint failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Add More CI Checks
Edit `.github/workflows/lego-moc-instructions-app.yml` to add:
- Bundle size analysis
- Visual regression testing
- Additional security scans
- Performance budgets

### Adjust Branch Protection
Edit `scripts/setup-branch-protection.sh` to modify:
- Required reviewers count
- Admin bypass settings
- Additional status checks

## 🎉 You're Protected!

Your frontend now has **enterprise-grade CI/CD protection**:

- ✅ **No broken code** can be merged
- ✅ **Quality standards** are enforced
- ✅ **Security issues** are caught early
- ✅ **Team workflow** is standardized

**Next Steps**: Set up branch protection rules and test the workflow with a sample PR!
