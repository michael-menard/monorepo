description: Canonical component catalog for reuse-first development

- **Gallery**
  - Import from: `@features/gallery`
  - Acceptable variations: cards, masonry, lightbox â†’ compose via props/slots; avoid forking
  - If a missing prop/slot is required, extend the canonical component rather than building a duplicate

- **General**
  - Shared resources live under `packages/**`; prefer these over app-local duplicates
  - Use path aliases for imports and update existing modules instead of creating parallel versions

- **Reference**
  - See [cursor_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc)
