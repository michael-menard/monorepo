description: Enforce strict, minimal, file-scoped edits and prohibit unrelated changes
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true

- **Never modify files outside explicitly named targets in the user prompt**
  - If no explicit targets are listed, ask for them before editing
  - Refuse to create, delete, or move files unless explicitly requested

- **Respect selection boundaries**
  - When the user selects text or provides markers, only edit inside that region
  - Prefer markers: `// BEGIN AI EDIT` ... `// END AI EDIT`

- **Generate an edit plan before any edits**
  - Provide a short list of files to change and why
  - If uncertainty exists about scope, ask for confirmation before editing

- **Prefer updating existing code over creating new files**
  - If a new file is unavoidable, propose the exact path and wait for approval

- **Diff discipline**
  - Output diffs that match the approved plan only
  - If extra file changes become necessary, stop and present a revised plan first

- **Testing policy for edit steps**
  - Do not add or update tests unless the user explicitly asks for it in this step

- **Reference**
  - See [cursor_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc) for rule formatting
