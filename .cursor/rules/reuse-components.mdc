description: Prefer existing shared components over creating new ones; use canonical imports
globs: **/*
alwaysApply: true

- **Reuse before create**
  - Before proposing new UI or logic, search the codebase for an existing component/module that fits
  - If one exists, use it; if not suitable, explain why in 1â€“2 bullets and propose edits to the canonical component instead of a new one

- **Canonical sources (must-use import paths)**
  - Gallery: `@features/gallery` (single source of truth)
  - UI primitives: `@ui/*`
  - Shared resources: `packages/**` exports should be preferred over app-local copies

- **Creation guardrails**
  - Do not create files named `*Gallery*.tsx` or folders named `*Gallery*` outside `packages/features/gallery/**` without explicit user approval
  - Prefer updating existing exports over adding new components

- **Imports**
  - Prefer path aliases (e.g., `@features/gallery`, `@ui/*`) over deep relative paths
