This PR is designed to test CodeRabbit's AI review capabilities.

### üéØ Expected CodeRabbit Feedback

CodeRabbit should identify and suggest fixes for:

1. **Performance Issues:**
   - Missing \`useCallback\` for event handlers
   - Expensive calculation in render (should use \`useMemo\`)

2. **Accessibility Issues:**
   - Missing \`aria-label\` attributes on buttons
   - Suggest semantic HTML improvements

3. **Security Issues:**
   - Hardcoded API key (should use environment variables)

4. **Code Quality:**
   - Unused variables that should be removed
   - React best practices

5. **TypeScript:**
   - Missing type annotations
   - Suggest interface definitions

### üîç Testing Checklist

- [ ] CodeRabbit bot comments appear within 2-5 minutes
- [ ] Status check \"CodeRabbit AI Review\" appears
- [ ] Status check \"Quality Gates\" appears  
- [ ] Merge is blocked until checks pass
- [ ] CodeRabbit provides actionable suggestions

### üìä Success Criteria

‚úÖ CodeRabbit identifies at least 3 of the intentional issues
‚úÖ Status checks prevent merge until review is complete
‚úÖ Suggestions are relevant and actionable
