# Auth Service Removal - Complete ✅

## Date: October 27, 2025

## Summary
Successfully removed the legacy Express-based `auth-service` and completed migration to AWS Cognito serverless authentication.

## What Was Removed

### 1. Auth Service Directory
- ✅ Deleted `apps/api/auth-service/` (entire directory)
- ✅ Deleted `apps/api/auth-service-lambda/` (PostgreSQL schema only, no longer needed)

### 2. Infrastructure
- ✅ Removed `.github/workflows/auth-service.yml`
- ✅ Removed `.github/workflows/deploy-auth-service.yml`
- ✅ Removed `infrastructure/lib/auth-service-apprunner-stack.ts`
- ✅ Removed `infrastructure/bin/auth-apprunner.ts`

### 3. Package.json Scripts
- ✅ Removed `logs:auth` from root package.json
- ✅ Removed `seed:users` scripts from root package.json

### 4. Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated `CLAUDE.md` to reflect Cognito architecture
- ✅ Removed auth-service references from service ports
- ✅ Updated backend services section

### 5. Code Fixes
- ✅ Fixed `apps/web/lego-moc-instructions-app/src/main.tsx` - removed missing `testAuth.ts` import
- ✅ Fixed `apps/api/auth-service-cognito/package.json` - set infrastructure-only build script

## Current Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
User -> Frontend (AWS Amplify/Cognito SDK) -> AWS Cognito User Pool
                                            -> Issues JWT tokens

Frontend -> API Request with JWT -> lego-projects-api validates JWT -> PostgreSQL
```

### Services
1. **auth-service-cognito** (Infrastructure only)
   - CDK stack for Cognito User Pool
   - Location: `apps/api/auth-service-cognito/infrastructure/`
   - No Lambda functions - pure Cognito managed service

2. **lego-projects-api** (Express API)
   - Validates Cognito JWT tokens
   - Stores LEGO MOC data in PostgreSQL
   - User IDs are Cognito sub claims (no user table)
   - Port: 9000

3. **Frontend** (React 19)
   - Uses AWS Amplify for Cognito integration
   - Sends JWT tokens with API requests
   - Port: 3002

## Verification

### Build Status
```bash
pnpm build
# ✅ All 19 tasks successful
# ✅ Frontend builds successfully
# ✅ lego-projects-api builds successfully
# ✅ auth-service-cognito skips build (infrastructure only)
```

### Type Checking
- ✅ `@repo/auth` - type checks pass
- ✅ `lego-projects-api` - type checks pass
- ⚠️ Frontend has pre-existing type errors (not related to auth removal)

## Known Issues (Pre-existing)

These are NOT related to the auth-service removal:

1. **Frontend Type Errors**: CSRF-related exports missing from `@repo/auth`
   - `getCSRFHeaders` not exported
   - `refreshCSRFToken` not exported
   - These may need cleanup if CSRF is still used with Cognito

2. **Tech Radar Package**: Has test type errors (unrelated to auth)

## Migration Notes

### For Future Reference
- **MongoDB auth data** is no longer needed - Cognito manages users
- **JWT secrets** are managed by Cognito - no manual secret rotation
- **Email verification** handled by Cognito (using Cognito email service)
- **Password reset** handled by Cognito flows
- **Session management** handled by Cognito refresh tokens

### Environment Variables Removed
- `AUTH_SERVICE_PORT` - no longer needed (removed from active services)
- Note: May still exist in `.env` for backward compatibility

### Next Steps (Optional)
1. Clean up unused CSRF utilities if not needed with Cognito
2. Remove MongoDB connection if only used for auth
3. Update E2E tests to use Cognito test users
4. Remove `AUTH_SERVICE_PORT` from `.env` file
5. Update any deployment scripts that referenced old auth-service

## Rollback Plan

If you need to recover the old auth-service code:
```bash
# View git history
git log --all --full-history -- apps/api/auth-service/

# Restore from specific commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- apps/api/auth-service/
```

The last commit with auth-service intact is in git history.
