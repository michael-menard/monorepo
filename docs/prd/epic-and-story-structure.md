# Epic and Story Structure

## Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale

Based on the analysis of the existing LEGO MOC Instructions project, this enhancement should be structured as a **single comprehensive epic** because:

1. **Interconnected Changes**: The three modernization components (modular architecture, serverless backend, UX enhancement) are tightly coupled and must be coordinated
2. **Shared Dependencies**: All changes rely on the same existing codebase, shared components, and infrastructure
3. **Unified Goal**: All components work toward the same objective of modernizing the frontend architecture
4. **Risk Management**: A single epic allows for better coordination of rollback strategies and testing
5. **Existing Foundation**: The strong existing modular package structure supports a coordinated approach
