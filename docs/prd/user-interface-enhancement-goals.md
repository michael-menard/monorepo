# User Interface Enhancement Goals

## Integration with Existing UI

The enhanced design system will build upon the existing Tailwind CSS v4 foundation and custom color palette. New components will extend the current `@repo/ui` package structure while maintaining consistency with existing design tokens. The modular applications will share the enhanced design system through the centralized shared component library, ensuring visual consistency across all modules.

## Modified/New Screens and Views

**Enhanced Screens**:

- **Gallery Module**: Modern card layouts, improved filtering, enhanced image viewing
- **Wishlist Module**: Better list management, drag-and-drop functionality, sharing features
- **MOC Instructions Module**: Improved step-by-step navigation, better file management
- **Profile Module**: Enhanced user settings, improved account management
- **Main Shell**: Modern navigation, unified header, improved responsive layout

**New Components**:

- Skeleton loading screens for all modules
- Toast notification system
- Enhanced modal and dialog components
- Progressive image loading components
- Accessibility-first form components

## UI Consistency Requirements

- All modular applications must use the shared design system components
- Color palette and typography must remain consistent across modules
- Loading states and error handling must follow unified patterns
- Navigation and routing transitions must provide seamless user experience
- Responsive breakpoints and mobile experience must be consistent
