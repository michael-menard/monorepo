## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - 10 minutes

**Description:** Provocative questions to expand thinking beyond initial constraints and explore blue-sky possibilities.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. **Predictive Recommendations**: Web scraper that creates a list of upcoming/newly released sets, then filters to personalized recommendations based on user preferences (themes, piece counts, complexity levels, color palettes, parts compatibility)

2. **Actionable Insights**:
   - "You have 87% of the parts for 'Millennium Falcon MOC' - buy these 15 missing pieces to complete it"
   - "Based on your current inventory, here are 5 MOCs you could build RIGHT NOW"
   - "Your next best investment: buying X part would unlock 12 more buildable MOCs"

3. **One-Click Parts Ordering**: Direct path from MOC selection to automated parts list to order fulfillment (BrickLink, LEGO Pick-a-Brick, etc.)
   - "3 MOCs ready to order - total cost: $47.23" with single "Order All" button
   - Price comparison across vendors
   - Smart bundling to save on shipping

4. **AI Integration Focus**: Instead of social features, focus on AI agent automations and chat interface for personal LEGO management and project planning

**Insights Discovered:**

- The dashboard should be proactive, not just reactive - suggesting actions rather than just displaying data
- Reducing friction in parts acquisition is a major value driver
- AI can transform the experience from "database" to "intelligent assistant"
- Social features are explicitly out of scope for MVP (Phase 2 consideration)

**Notable Connections:**

- Recommendation engine + parts inventory = "you can build this inspiration image with 80% of parts you already own"
- Budget tracking + one-click ordering = informed purchasing decisions
- AI chat + all dashboard features = natural language interface layer

### SCAMPER Method - 30 minutes

**Description:** Systematic exploration using Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange prompts.

**Ideas Generated:**

#### S - Substitute

1. Replace static number tiles with **data visualizations**: gauges, line graphs, scatterplots, heatmaps
2. Replace "last 10 MOCs" list with multiple **gallery types**:
   - List view for recent MOCs (keep this)
   - MOC Gallery for all user's MOCs
   - Sets Gallery for official LEGO sets owned
   - **Inspiration Gallery** for user-curated images to use as build inspiration (like Pinterest for LEGO)

#### C - Combine

3. **Calendar integration**: AI detects free time in user's calendar → suggests building sessions ("You have 3 hours free Saturday afternoon - perfect for that Medium complexity MOC!")
4. **Smart inspiration matching**: Analyze inspiration images against inventory → "You're 80% there, just need these 15 pieces"
5. **LEGO Events API integration**: Surface relevant events (conventions, store events, competitions)
6. **Parts intelligence by purpose**: Track certain colors/bricks used for specific techniques
   - Green slopes = terrain/trees
   - Trans-clear = windows/water
   - Dark tan = rockwork
   - AI suggests: "You have lots of green plates - perfect for a landscape MOC!"
7. **Theme tracking**: Categorize MOCs by theme (Star Wars, Castle, Space, etc.) for analysis

#### A - Adapt

8. **From Fitness Apps (Strava, Peloton)**: Build streaks, achievements, personal records ("Fastest 500-piece build!")
9. **From Financial Apps (Mint, YNAB)**: Budget tracking for LEGO spending, "investment" value of collection
10. **From Travel Apps (TripAdvisor)**: Wishlist system for MOCs (already planned)
11. **From Audible**: Annual Building Challenge - set yearly goals (# of MOCs, total pieces, themes to try)
    - End-of-year recap with visual showcase of everything completed
    - **"Your Year in LEGO"** summary (like Spotify Wrapped!)
    - Progress tracking throughout year
    - Shareable achievement graphics
12. **From BookTube Reflection Prompts**: LEGO-specific questionnaires
    - "Which MOC surprised you the most this year?"
    - "What theme do you want to try but haven't?"
    - "Most challenging build you completed?"
    - "Build you're most proud of?"
    - "What technique did you master this year?"
    - Monthly/yearly reflection prompts on dashboard
    - Could inform AI recommendations

#### M - Modify/Magnify

13. **Expand activity feed**: Full timeline beyond just last 10 MOCs (scrollable, filterable - "Show me all MOCs I added in 2024")
14. **Customizable dashboard**: Users pick their tiles/widgets (drag-and-drop layouts, save configurations, presets)
15. **Mood-based AI recommendations**:
    - Creative mode → experimental/unusual MOCs
    - Relaxing mode → simple, therapeutic builds
    - Challenge mode → complex, high-piece-count projects
    - Quick win mode → builds you can finish today
16. **Journey-stage adaptation**: Dashboard evolves with user
    - Brand new user: "Welcome! Let's add your first MOC"
    - Growing collection: Focus on organization and discovery
    - Power user: Advanced analytics, bulk operations, API integrations
    - Collector focus: Value tracking, set completion percentages
    - Builder focus: Build queue, time tracking, technique library

#### E - Eliminate

17. **Smart URL ingestion**: Eliminate manual data entry
    - Paste LEGO.com link → AI/automation extracts set name, piece count, theme, price, manual PDF
    - BrickLink MOCs → Extract MOC details, parts list, images, instructions
    - Rebrickable → Import alternate builds and parts data
    - Other MOC sites (MOCpages, etc.)
    - Zero manual typing required
18. **Proactive project nudges**: Eliminate cognitive load of remembering abandoned projects
    - "You created 'Modular Castle' 3 months ago but haven't added parts - still interested?"
    - "Your 'Space Station MOC' has been paused for 6 weeks - want to resume or archive it?"
    - Smart timing (weekly check-ins, not annoying)
    - Option to snooze/archive/delete

**Insights Discovered:**

- The dashboard needs to be **lightweight and joyful**, not a chore that gets in the way of building
- Multiple data visualization types serve different analytical needs
- AI can eliminate tedious work (data entry, remembering tasks) while adding value (recommendations, insights)
- Gamification should be subtle and opt-in, not forced
- Financial tracking is a major differentiator - LEGO is both expensive hobby AND investment

**Notable Connections:**

- Customizable dashboard + journey-stage adaptation = personalized experience that grows with user
- Mood-based recommendations + calendar integration = contextual suggestions at the right time
- Theme tracking + budget analysis + parts intelligence = multi-dimensional understanding of collection
- Annual challenge + reflection prompts + year-end recap = emotional engagement with the hobby

  - Technique library linked to required parts
  - "You have the parts to try advanced SNOT techniques"
  - Build recommendations based on parts you're collecting

### Insights & Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

- **Lightweight is critical**: The dashboard should enhance building joy, not become a chore that blocks it. Users should be able to ignore it entirely if they just want to build.

- **AI as enabler, not gimmick**: Focus AI on eliminating tedious work (data entry, remembering tasks, finding deals) rather than flashy features. The chat interface is valuable, but the automation is the real power.

- **Financial transparency drives value**: LEGO is an expensive hobby AND an investment. Users want to understand spending, track value, and make informed purchasing decisions. This is a major differentiator from competitors.

- **Multiple gallery types serve different needs**: All MOCs (organization), Sets (collection tracking), Inspiration (ideation), Recent (context). Each serves a distinct use case and all are essential.

- **Tabbed layout > Long scroll**: For a dashboard, tabs reduce cognitive load and allow focused views. Each tab has a clear purpose.

- **Data visualization diversity matters**: Different chart types answer different questions. Gauge = progress, Pie = composition, Scatter = relationships. Don't force everything into one viz type.

- **Social comes later**: Explicitly scoped out for Phase 2. MVP is about individual user value, not community features. This focus is important for launch.

- **Automation > Manual entry**: Every piece of manual data entry is friction. URL ingestion, auto-pricing, project nudges - eliminate toil wherever possible.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Overview Tab with Metrics & Visualizations

**Rationale:**
This is the foundation of the dashboard and the primary value proposition. Users land here after login and immediately understand the state of their collection. Without this, there's no "dashboard" - just navigation to other features. The combination of metrics (quick facts) and visualizations (analytical depth) creates a compelling at-a-glance experience.

**Next steps:**

1. Design metric tile components (reusable, themeable)
2. Implement data aggregation queries for 5 core metrics
3. Build 3 chart components (Gauge, Pie/Doughnut, Scatterplot)
4. Create responsive grid layout for metrics
5. Implement tab structure with Overview as default
6. Wire up clickable metrics to filtered views
7. Add loading states and empty states
8. Test performance with large datasets (1000+ MOCs)

**Resources needed:**

- Frontend: React developer (2 weeks)
- Backend: API endpoints for metric aggregation (1 week)
- Design: Chart library selection (Recharts, Victory, D3) and visual design (3 days)
- Data: Sample datasets for testing

**Timeline:**
3 weeks for complete Overview tab (metrics + visualizations + layout)

---

#### #2 Priority: Four Gallery System

**Rationale:**
Galleries are the core content management functionality. Users need to see, browse, and organize their MOCs, Sets, and Inspiration. This is table-stakes functionality that enables all other features. The Activity feed provides context and history. Without galleries, the app has no real utility beyond metrics.

**Next steps:**

1. Design gallery card/list components (thumbnail, title, metadata, status badges)
2. Implement MOC Gallery with filtering and sorting
3. Implement Sets Gallery with similar UI patterns
4. Implement Inspiration Gallery (image-focused, Pinterest-style)
5. Build Activity feed/timeline component
6. Create "Recent 10" list component
7. Implement pagination or infinite scroll for large collections
8. Add search functionality within galleries
9. Wire up FAB "+ Add MOC/Set" to creation flows

**Resources needed:**

- Frontend: React developer (3-4 weeks)
- Backend: Gallery API endpoints with filtering/sorting (2 weeks)
- Design: Gallery layouts, card designs, image optimization strategy
- Image handling: CDN setup, thumbnail generation, lazy loading

**Timeline:**
4-5 weeks for all four galleries + activity timeline

---

#### #3 Priority: Financial Intelligence (Budget Tab + Parts Database)

**Rationale:**
This is the major differentiator from competitors and addresses a real pain point for LEGO enthusiasts. Understanding collection value and tracking spending is hugely valuable. The parts database enables cost-to-build calculations, which inform purchasing decisions. This feature transforms the app from "organizer" to "financial advisor for LEGO."

**Next steps:**

1. Research and select parts pricing data sources (BrickLink API, BrickOwl, others)
2. Design parts database schema with pricing history
3. Implement web scraper with cron scheduling
4. Build price aggregation and averaging logic
5. Create MOC cost calculator (sum parts × prices)
6. Design Budget tab UI (monthly budget input, spending bars, theme breakdown)
7. Implement budget tracking data model
8. Build spending analytics (by theme, by month, by type)
9. Create budget alerts/warnings (approaching limit)
10. Add transaction history/log

**Resources needed:**

- Backend: Database design, scraper implementation, pricing APIs (3-4 weeks)
- Frontend: Budget tab UI and charts (2 weeks)
- DevOps: Cron job setup, monitoring, error handling (1 week)
- Data: Initial parts database seeding (can be phased)
- Legal: Review terms of service for pricing data sources

**Timeline:**
5-6 weeks for complete financial intelligence features

## Reflection & Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- **Progressive flow technique**: Starting broad (What If) then systematically exploring (SCAMPER) generated diverse ideas while maintaining structure
- **Blue-sky mindset**: Explicitly scoping as "no constraints" allowed ambitious ideas like AI agents and smart image matching
- **Strategic focus shift**: Early pivot from social features to AI/personal management kept session aligned with actual product vision
- **Specificity in convergence**: Moving from "data visualizations" to exact chart types (gauge, pie, scatter) with detailed specs made ideas actionable
- **Collaborative refinement**: Layout iteration (scrolling → tabs → clean navbar) showed real-time synthesis and decision-making
- **Balancing aspiration with pragmatism**: Clear bucketing of ideas into MVP/Phase 2/Moonshots prevents scope creep while preserving future vision

### Areas for Further Exploration

- **AI chat interaction patterns**: What should the chat UI/UX look like? Always visible? Minimized? Modal? What's the right balance of proactive vs. reactive?
- **Parts database governance**: How often to refresh pricing? How to handle price volatility? Should users be able to override/customize prices?
- **Customization boundaries**: How much dashboard customization is valuable vs. overwhelming? Should there be presets or total freedom?
- **Mobile experience priorities**: Which features are most important on mobile vs. desktop? Should mobile have different defaults?
- **Build time estimation algorithm**: What factors predict build time? Piece count? Complexity? User skill level? How to collect training data?
- **Theme taxonomy**: How should themes be categorized? User-defined tags? Predefined list? Both? How to handle sets that span multiple themes?
- **Empty states and onboarding**: What does the dashboard look like for a brand new user with zero MOCs? How to guide them to add their first content?

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **User Story Mapping**: Create detailed user journeys for different personas (new user, collector, builder) to identify missing flows
- **Assumption Testing**: Identify risky assumptions (e.g., "users will want AI recommendations") and design validation experiments
- **Competitive Analysis**: Deep dive on similar platforms (Rebrickable, BrickLink, LEGO.com) to understand feature gaps and opportunities
- **Technical Spiking**: Prototype parts pricing scraper and AI chat interface to validate technical feasibility before full commitment
- **Five Whys on Financial Features**: Dig deeper into "why budget tracking?" to ensure we're solving the right problem

### Questions That Emerged

- How do users define "themes" - is it LEGO official themes, or custom categorization?
- What's the ideal refresh frequency for parts pricing data to balance accuracy and API costs?
- Should the scatterplot be interactive in Phase 2, or intentionally kept static?
- How do we handle MOCs that span multiple themes (e.g., "Star Wars Castle")?
- What's the right default sort order for galleries - recently added? Alphabetical? Most expensive?
- Should budget tracking include non-parts spending (display cases, sorting containers, tools)?
- How granular should activity tracking be? Every field edit, or just major actions?
- What constitutes a "stale project" - time threshold? User-defined? Contextual?
- Should inspiration images be stored locally or just links? What about copyright/attribution?
- How do we handle sets that users own multiple copies of (for parts farming)?

### Next Session Planning

**Suggested topics:**

1. **PRD Development Workshop**: Convert brainstorming results into formal Product Requirements Document with user stories, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications
2. **Technical Architecture Session**: Design system architecture for parts database, scraper infrastructure, and API design
3. **UI/UX Design Sprint**: Create wireframes and mockups for all four tabs with responsive breakpoints
4. **AI Strategy Deep Dive**: Define AI agent capabilities, chat interface patterns, and recommendation algorithms

**Recommended timeframe:**

- PRD session: Within 1 week (while ideas are fresh)
- Technical architecture: 1-2 weeks (after PRD approval)
- UI/UX design: 2 weeks (parallel with architecture)
- AI strategy: 3-4 weeks (after MVP scope is locked)

**Preparation needed:**

- Review this brainstorming document
- Gather any existing technical documentation (architecture diagrams, database schemas)
- Collect competitive examples and inspiration for UI/UX session
- Identify technical stakeholders who should participate in architecture session
- Prepare questions or concerns about any ideas in this document
