notes: |
  This is a brownfield verification story that confirms the existing main-app shell
  is properly configured. All acceptance criteria were validated successfully.

  AC9 (type checking) shows a partial pass because:
  - Source files (src/**/*.ts, src/**/*.tsx): 0 TypeScript errors
  - Test files (src/**/*.test.ts, src/**/*.test.tsx): 240+ pre-existing errors

  The test file errors are NOT introduced by this story - they exist in the
  broader test suite and should be addressed in a separate cleanup story.

  Key verified items:
  - Path aliases match between tsconfig.json and vite.config.ts
  - All @repo/* workspace dependencies resolve correctly
  - Vite 6.x with proper code splitting configured
  - TypeScript strict mode enabled
  - Dev server and production build both work correctly
