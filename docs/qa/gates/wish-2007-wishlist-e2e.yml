gate: PENDING
status_reason: >-
  New real-environment Playwright E2E specs have been added for wishlist
  gallery, add item, delete / Got It, and reorder flows. Gate remains
  PENDING until the suite has been stabilized in CI and run across
  multiple pipelines without flakiness.

  performance:
    status: PARTIAL
    notes: >-
      Gallery real E2E spec asserts a basic performance bound on initial
      load time for a small test dataset (< 5 seconds in CI). No synthetic
      load or stress testing is performed in this story.
  reliability:
    status: PARTIAL
    notes: >-
      Tests verify that core flows (gallery, add, delete, Got It, reorder)
      run end-to-end against real services. Flakiness will be monitored
      after initial CI rollout.
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: >-
      Real wishlist E2E specs live under apps/web/playwright/tests/e2e/wishlist
      and share helpers for login + API-driven setup/teardown.
  accessibility:
    status: PARTIAL
    notes: >-
      Real E2E specs assert basic semantic roles (heading, buttons, inputs)
      and labels. Full a11y coverage is handled by story wish-2006.
