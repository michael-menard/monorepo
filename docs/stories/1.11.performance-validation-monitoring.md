# Story 1.11: Performance Validation and Monitoring

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive performance monitoring and validation of the modernized application,
**so that** I can ensure the modernization meets all performance and reliability targets.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Performance benchmarking completed comparing old vs new architecture
2. Bundle size analysis shows 20% reduction for typical user journeys
3. API response time monitoring confirms serverless performance targets
4. User experience metrics tracking implemented
5. Error monitoring and alerting configured for modular architecture
6. Rollback procedures documented and tested

## Integration Verification

- **IV1**: All performance targets met or exceeded (15% load time improvement, 50% build time reduction)
- **IV2**: System reliability maintained or improved compared to monolithic architecture
- **IV3**: Monitoring and alerting systems provide adequate visibility into system health

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context

This story establishes comprehensive performance validation and monitoring for the complete modernized application. It validates that all performance targets are met and establishes ongoing monitoring to ensure the system continues to perform optimally in production.
