# Story 3.1.26: E2E + A11y + Performance — Playwright Suite

## Status

Approved

## Story

As a team,
we want end-to-end confidence with a11y and perf checks,
so we can ship the uploader with quality gates.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. E2E flows (Playwright)

- Happy path: presign → upload → finalize → appears in My Instructions.
- Error flows: expired links refresh; 409 slug fix; 429 countdown; 401 restore intent.

2. A11y checks

- Run axe-core checks on key screens; no critical violations.

3. Perf budget

- Uploader route TTI ≤ 2.5s on mid-range laptop; bundle size budget documented; lazy-load modules.

4. CI integration

- Pipeline job to run E2E and a11y; artifacts (videos, traces) on failure.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Set up apps/web/playwright tests for uploader
- [ ] Seed/mocks for API and S3
- [ ] CI wiring and docs

## Dev Notes

- Keep tests resilient; prefer data-testid for stable selectors where needed; otherwise use roles.
