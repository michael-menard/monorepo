# Next Steps

## Immediate Actions

1. **Stakeholder Review:** Present this specification to development team and product stakeholders for feedback and approval
2. **Design System Creation:** Begin creating detailed Figma components based on the specifications outlined above
3. **Prototype Development:** Create interactive prototypes for key user flows to validate design decisions
4. **Accessibility Audit:** Conduct initial accessibility review of current application to identify specific improvement areas
5. **Performance Baseline:** Establish current performance metrics to measure improvement against

## Design Handoff Checklist

- ✅ All user flows documented with detailed interaction patterns
- ✅ Component inventory complete with variants and states
- ✅ Accessibility requirements defined with specific compliance targets
- ✅ Responsive strategy clear with breakpoints and adaptation patterns
- ✅ Brand guidelines incorporated with extended color palette and typography
- ✅ Performance goals established with measurable targets

**Ready for Architecture Phase:** This UI/UX specification provides the foundation for the frontend architecture phase, where technical implementation details will be defined to support these design requirements across the modular application structure.
