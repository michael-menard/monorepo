# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the LEGO MOC Instructions App's modernized user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience across all modular applications.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**LEGO Enthusiast Builder**: Adult fans of LEGO (AFOLs) who create custom MOCs and want to document and share their building instructions. They value detailed documentation, high-quality images, and community features.

**Inspiration Seeker**: LEGO fans looking for new building ideas and inspiration. They prioritize easy browsing, visual discovery, and the ability to save interesting builds to their wishlist.

**Instruction Creator**: Advanced builders who create comprehensive step-by-step instructions for their MOCs. They need robust file management, editing capabilities, and tools for organizing complex builds.

**Community Member**: Social users who engage with the LEGO building community through sharing, commenting, and collaborating. They value social features, user profiles, and community interaction.

### Usability Goals

- **Intuitive Discovery**: New users can find and explore MOC instructions within 2 minutes of landing on the site
- **Efficient Creation**: Experienced users can upload and organize a new MOC instruction set in under 10 minutes
- **Seamless Navigation**: Users can move between gallery, wishlist, instructions, and profile without losing context
- **Mobile Optimization**: All core functionality works efficiently on mobile devices with touch-friendly interactions
- **Accessibility First**: All users, including those using assistive technologies, can access and use all features

### Design Principles

1. **Visual Clarity over Complexity** - Prioritize clear, scannable layouts that highlight LEGO builds and instructions
2. **Progressive Enhancement** - Start with essential functionality and layer on advanced features
3. **Consistent Interaction Patterns** - Use familiar UI patterns that users recognize from modern web applications
4. **Immediate Visual Feedback** - Every user action provides clear, immediate visual confirmation
5. **Inclusive Design** - Design for all users regardless of ability, device, or technical expertise
