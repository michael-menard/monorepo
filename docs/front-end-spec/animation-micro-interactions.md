# Animation & Micro-interactions

## Motion Principles

Animations should feel natural and purposeful, providing feedback and guiding user attention. Use easing curves that feel organic (ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits). Keep animations fast (200-300ms) for UI feedback, longer (400-500ms) for page transitions. Respect user preferences for reduced motion.

## Key Animations

- **Page Transitions:** Slide transitions between main sections (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Modal Entrance:** Scale and fade in from center (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Button Feedback:** Subtle scale on press (Duration: 100ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Card Hover:** Gentle lift with shadow increase (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Loading States:** Skeleton shimmer and spinner animations (Duration: 1.5s loop, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Success Feedback:** Checkmark animation with color transition (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Image Loading:** Progressive blur-to-sharp transition (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
