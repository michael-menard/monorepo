          # Auggie Integration Context
          
          This PR was developed with assistance from Auggie (Augment AI). 
          
          ## Project Context
          - Monorepo structure with apps/ and packages/
          - TypeScript/React stack
          - Uses Turbo for build orchestration
          - Follows patterns defined in AUGGIE_RULES.md
          
          ## Key Areas for Review
          1. Adherence to monorepo patterns
          2. TypeScript best practices
          3. React component patterns
          4. Security considerations
          5. Performance implications
          6. Accessibility compliance
          7. Test coverage
          
          ## Integration Notes
          - Auggie handles implementation details
          - CodeRabbit provides code quality review
          - Both tools should complement each other
